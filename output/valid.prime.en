you know , one of the big <unk> the travel and a the misfortunes that the <unk> research is , together with the people , the , the old days of you can . the your past , still in the wind will feel , you on the rain <unk> of touch , in the bitter dregs of the leaves the plants and taste .
just that to know , <unk> still living beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myths , the oldest on the inuit -- still a full of these are , that in the himalayas , the buddhists and still the breath of <unk> tracking , which means , the revelation of anthropology research into memory to call , that 's the idea that the world , in the we live , not in a total of it exists , but just as a model of reality , as a result of a group of possibilities of adapt the our ancestors , <unk> successful , ago , many generations of chose .
and of course , sharing , we all the same <unk> .
we all be born . we get kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we 're bound with the <unk> of the death of cells and it to us not surprise , we all the singing , dancing and and art that humans .
but there 's the unique vocal cadence of <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and plays it does n't matter , whether it , the <unk> , in the of borneo -- is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior , <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the sahara . this is to the colleague , i a month ago in the desert was traveling . or even a <unk> , the fact , on the <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us , it , other <unk> , some of thinking , other ways to where the earth there .
and that 's a kind of the , if you think about , with just hope to meet .
together and the thousands and cultures , the world a net of <unk> and cultural hero , that the earth at stake , and for that probably the earth as important is the biological <unk> , that you as the biosphere , if you know .
you can , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can , as the sum of thoughts and dreams , which is the ideas , inspirations -- and experimentation , of the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness , by were to be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
they did this symbol of all to what we 're and what we as an amazing <unk> species are capable .
and just like the biosphere , away , was this with the <unk> -- just with still going to speed .
not a biologist , for instance , dare to suggest to 50 percent or more all kinds of a moment ago , the extinction are , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> the area of of biodiversity -- that hardly the , which gives us as <unk> <unk> the area of cultural diversity , is .
and the critical to be for this is the extinction of languages .
when everybody of them in this room was born , were on the emotions and talking about .
now is a language not just the totality of the vocabulary belongs , or a series of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human spirit .
you is a means , the soul of a culture , access to the material world will find .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual .
and of these are 6,000 different languages are today , as we 're here in monterey sit , exactly half the not more in the ears of children <unk> .
they 're going infants do n't even more about teaching . that is , if nothing done is , they 're actually already been dead .
what might be lonely be , as the silence , at stake , one of your people to be , your language to talk , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , both , or the hope for kids to ?
and yet , stamp this horrible epidemic of fact , somebody somewhere on the earth , about . all the two weeks , because of two weeks , and dies a older , man and take the last <unk> of the language , the grave .
and i know , some of you say , it 's not better than that ? '' would be the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to talk , you ? '' and i say , '' well , let this language , yoruba . let you <unk> be .
let you kogi . ''
and then you suddenly realize , how it , if you their own language ca n't could talk .
so i want you today , of on a trip across the <unk> take , a quick trip across the <unk> to try to you expected to do , what actually lost gone .
now there 's some under us , the way , forget , they said , when i say `` different ways of being , '' really different ways of being mean .
they take up for this child the <unk> in the northwest , the amazon , the nation of <unk> , believe , <unk> the <unk> from east , from the belly of sacred , snakes <unk> .
that 's a seafaring people , which is not being cognitively far between the colors , blue , and green is , that <unk> the forest that the people depend on , <unk> is .
they have a dip to language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have to marry someone , a different language , talks .
all this is rooted in the mythological past . that dip to , these big houses , in perspective , because of the <unk> six or seven languages could talk , it is , you never catching somebody who hear , a learns language .
so you 're just to and start then to talk .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , i ever lived have the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first , 1958 , peaceful and contact .
in the year 1957 , trying to five <unk> with lots and did a <unk> mistakes .
they threw a new form of their own , from the air down , what we as kind , the rate , you . and forgetting that you , that these people from the rainforest in your life , never be something <unk> had seen .
they raised these photographs from floor , i tried behind the face or the figure out to see , we found nothing , and <unk> , this business of the devil cancers be and killing the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> killed , not only be with the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of the deaths were happening through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two million cases of natural death and when we the people with really something about <unk> , they took to , one of the people so old become was , he 's because of his age , and we 're killing him , with the spear .
but the same time they had a knowledge of the forest , the amazing .
their business of us to the urine of an animal from 40 to go away you smell and name , which species , this was .
in the early <unk> years , i was a really amazing job , when i was my professor in the harvard and she said , if i that will be interested , in haiti , to go and the secret societies fail to infiltrate the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the venom , that for it was used to <unk> to do , sure .
to this sensation having a sense to give you had , i want something about this really believe in the <unk> know , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
the point , it 's , a complex of metaphysical way .
it 's interesting .
if i ask them , the world 's sale , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or what .
a continent will always leave out , because the ; it was , it in sub-saharan africa not religious people believe me give them . course there 's a and <unk> 's just the dawning of this very prize-winning religious thought , during the tragic diaspora to the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting , is this is a relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirit .
the spirit can see , under the water of evoking going to seek answers on the rhythm of the dance , the soul of living with whom out to , so that the <unk> for a shiny moment , god will .
to cram say the <unk> to , `` your white is in the church , and you talk about god .
we use dancing in the temples , and going to god . ''
and because you 're obsessed with you , you of the mind by . how can you damage the danger going ?
you see these amazing -- demonstrations , <unk> in a trance had the <unk> coal , burning <unk> , an amazing amount of the ability of mind the body , to influence that the it <unk> , when he in a state of extremes of state and then they will .
now , of people , i met you 've seen it , kogi from the sierra nevada de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most exceptional .
all around the old <unk> civilization , <unk> plain of colombia world , and in a result of conquest , moved , this people in a <unk> volcanic shield can , that about the <unk> plain there .
in a <unk> continent , were these people are the only , never of the <unk> conquered .
to today 's day , you will of a ritual that priesthood does . the training to that priesthood is , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be the age of three and four years of their families are separated and in a <unk> world , the pitch , in <unk> at a fab the glacier , for 18 years by that . two periods of each , nine years , you 're elected in the nine months of pregnancy emulate , you in your lap , of her mother to contribute to spend you now <unk> in your lap , the mother .
and during this whole time , they are culturally express in the value of society has introduced . values , the claim that , their prayer and only their prayer , the cosmic scene -- or we can say that environmental issues -- the equilibrium that .
but at this amazing <unk> you will one day , suddenly , out there 's taken and the first time in your life , the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in <unk> moment of consciousness of the first of the sun , starts to the <unk> the amazing to be a landscape , are going to suddenly everything , in abstract have learned in scale of grandeur confirms . and the priest of back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , i want you telling .
it 's so wonderful . you have it to protect them . ''
they call , the older , brothers and say , we , we the ones , brothers are , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition is very important .
, if we , then aboriginal and the landscape of thinking to invoke we 're either <unk> and the old lady who are the fancy wild up , which in its simplification of a <unk> idea is , or other thoreau and say , these people are more with the nature to , as we .
so , then aboriginal communities are n't sentimental , you will come out of nostalgia ill .
it stays not a place for the <unk> swamps , <unk> or the cold <unk> of tibet , they have , but anyway , through time and the ritual a mysterious <unk> the world shaped , not the idea is based , you realize that close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , only exist can , because they 're in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , what is that ?
it means , a little girl from the andes , in the think up the mountain in a <unk> is , the fact , or her destiny to determine , is a very , another person , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place have , as a little girl from montana , in the think up to a mountain under a bunch of stone is the heat away can be .
if he had a location of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
that 's interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the forest of british , colombia , and i thought , these forests that there are , <unk> .
that made me to a other people as my friends , among the <unk> , to believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> minds are the <unk> the world , the spirits , they look at their <unk> participate , you .
now , if you start to the idea to look at , these cultures across different realities , to create , you can kind of their extraordinary to understand . like . this plant here .
it 's a picture , that i just last april , in the northwest , the amazon on .
this is <unk> of the whole lot of you have heard , the most sorts preparation of his repertoire of the shamans live .
what <unk> so fascinating , is not only that <unk> potential of this <unk> , but of processing . it is really from two different sources . the a side , there 's these wooden <unk> , a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , hallucinogenic , inherent . this <unk> just taking that 's about as if , a blue <unk> smoke on their minds put , it , with the leaves of <unk> from the family of <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> up .
this plant it contains some very strong <unk> the top of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you 've been even the <unk> have seen , this stuff <unk> , this substance , you from different ways to make it which is also <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> that 's about how from a <unk> throw , <unk> of the baroque paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it is no distortion of reality , , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard <unk> <unk> , the man , the psychedelic <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years that has , it was discussing . i said , you this <unk> not as highly hallucinogenic categorize it could , in the moment in the you the implications for us feel , you ca n't know , there is to a <unk> to learn .
but the thing with <unk> is the you to do n't <unk> held by can be , you through a in the human gut , <unk> enzyme , with names <unk> , <unk> be .
they can only in conjunction with some other chemicals <unk> held by going to the mao <unk> .
now that 's fascinating that the <unk> , in the <unk> of these are , <unk> of exactly the way that are , is necessary to the <unk> to <unk> . you ask , so itself .
how can these people from a <unk> of over 80,000 species <unk> plants , these two , morphologically just not related plants and find the hand , on this way , combined , a kind of <unk> version of creating , so that all than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism , trial and error , as being meaningless -- it turns out .
but what you the native americans tell you , `` the talks to us . ''
so , what is that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have to 17 different varieties , <unk> , they all the great distance in the forest is see , our eyes , as a way that appear .
and then ask you , their taxonomy arguably , and they say , i thought , you do something of plants .
i mean , you know anything at all ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns , out to you any of 17 different varieties , <unk> absolute and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
so , that brings them not a ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is , even those cracks under us , and sympathy for the hard to the native americans have , as <unk> and colorful , look , but somehow the past , one , during the world , that our world , progresses .
so , the fact is , you , that 20 . century , in 300 years , not for his righteous war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than , an era , in the we <unk> , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity around the earth , either the support his or becoming passive <unk> . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have , again , the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology , .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux , when you must bow and the arrow of tasks , as the americans who stopped americans , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change and technology could threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . that ugly face the rule .
and where anything that you , in the world <unk> , you will discover , these cultures , not the <unk> <unk> . this are very dynamic , uncontacted peoples , whose existence through the visible , these by going to the about their capacity of adapt to go out . whether it , and the vast logging in the country of the <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a seafaring people , that , one generation free in the forest , living , and now to <unk> and prostitution , the river <unk> was , where you can see , even the river with the mud , polluted water is , almost half of borneo , in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . of where the japanese <unk> at it to see are , are willing to their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill the you the forest away . or how the case of <unk> , where it <unk> are the advertisement during the <unk> <unk> .
or if we in the mountains of tibet , where i <unk> much on , you that ugly face the political and dominance .
you know , the genocide , that <unk> extinction of people will not secret of , <unk> , the destruction of the lifestyle and the people , will not just not just one of , but generally , and <unk> as part of <unk> celebrated .
and you can that suffering <unk> n't understand , if you ca n't it on <unk> level have seen .
and i went even with a young scientist colleagues got 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> after <unk> and only when i after <unk> came , i saw the face the statistics of you hear . emotions inside the monuments , in the rubble , and ash into . 1.2 million people , during the cultural revolution of the <unk> killed .
the father , this young fitting , as followers , the <unk> <unk> identified .
that meant , he during the chinese it immediately get killed .
be an uncle '' bug living with their sanctity in the diaspora , the people to nepal .
his mother was locked the punishment , for -- for the crime as wealthy .
he was the age of two years in the prison smuggled to , under your <unk> to hide , because they without it 's not life could .
the sister , this <unk> did <unk> , in a <unk> brought them .
one day he stepped you from one of on a tags and around and for these <unk> had to you for seven years in a heavy , labor .
that suffering <unk> can become intolerable be , <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end , we are really , a choice . we 've set in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity of life ?
margaret mead , now , the anthropologist who said before they died , it their greatest fear is , as we , a thread , <unk> , generic at the world move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination , on a <unk> way down would see , but that we one day from a dream up , and have forgotten , it ever other ways that there .
and it 's really humbling to like to think , our species , maybe for over 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , the agriculture . and , and us in the moment the cult of <unk> <unk> , the poetry , the shamans live by the purple prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and we have created -- i found , just 10,000 years .
the industrial world , how we do you know it 's hardly see 300 years old .
now , this was superficial story , i 'm not , we all the answers on the challenges have , which we are in the next for millennia to look .
if we do this thousands <unk> after the importance of human , the answers you with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song , we become the opportunity to rediscover the , what we are , people with being conscious , the importance of these are , that , and gardens , a room are happening to can <unk> to deal . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here 's a picture , that i the northern hemisphere is the end <unk> on , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , i told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit -- the others and during the <unk> years in part of the establishment of the rule , they were forced also , settlements , to move .
the grandfather of this old man who refused .
the family , the fear to be life was , took him all of guns and all the tools .
now to you know that the inuit -- not afraid , the cold . they used as you to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> , originally from fish , in <unk> wrapped up , it .
the grandfather of the man was afraid , not going on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> to find out , and his pants off , <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and as the feces to seize that started , shaped , he you in the form of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva and the sides of <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and the side of a <unk> , took this skeleton of the dog and the side of a <unk> , <unk> a other dog , and <unk> about the <unk> with the <unk> the belt .
so you go from nothing to do something .
and this is on many ways a symbol for the resistance of the inuit -- and all indigenous the world .
the canadian government was the inuit -- in april 1999 , the complete control over a field , that 's bigger than california , texas .
it 's our new country , and it means <unk> .
it 's a completely area . they control all <unk> .
a an example , like a nation , a state , atoning with his people , for , and you can achieve .
and ultimately , i think , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , to these distant for the earth , i went are , to see , that they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent the parts of human imagination , in times past the way back . and for all of us to be the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children in the geography of hope .
what we at national geographic , trying to is that we think , politicians ever get something to achieve .
we think , <unk> -- we think , <unk> not the case is , but we think , that storytelling in the world , and so we 're probably the institution for storytelling in the world . our website , 35 million ones transmitted every month .
156 nations to send our tv .
we make magazines , of millions of reading .
and we company a series of travel in the <unk> , which we are our audience to places of such as cultural and wonder take you to the looked at , by going . and hopefully , you will one after the other 's the revelation of anthropology assume , that this world 's made , on different ways to exist , we have a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find , the wisdom of people to our shared and well-being we can contribute .
thank you .
what you -- i first , so as fast , you 'll see , is the fundamental work , a new technology , we microsoft , as part of <unk> ago exactly a year , who have . that 's <unk> . and it 's an environment , in the you either local or away with huge amounts of visual quality data can deal .
we see a lot , gigabytes , digital photographs here , you will seamlessly , and that <unk> , pan , on any way , arranged .
and it 's no matter , how many of information we look at the size of these collections that are or how big the images .
the most of you 're using digital photos of a camera , but this is here , for a scan of the congress and it 's in a range of 300 <unk> .
it makes no difference , because the only what the point of the system like this is constrained can , is the number , a pixel on your screen in every moment . it also has a very large numbers of architecture .
this is a whole book , an example for <unk> .
that 's <unk> house of <unk> . any tearing is a chapter .
to prove to think it , really to a text and not to a picture is , we do something like that do , to really to show , this is a real specific representation of <unk> and not a picture is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of <unk> .
and that there you really the pleasure and the good experience of a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , what , a kind of medium with several scales .
we also something , the corner of these special edition of the guardian did .
we have a wrong with this is very high , which are designed , much higher than at a normal this is , and we have to the content to it .
if you the features of this , you want to do you see here .
or different models , or even more technical <unk> .
and this time , and really these ideas on , these constraints , for the place on the screen arguments that .
we hope that the n't add pop-ups and other nonsense , which means -- that should n't be necessary .
now , is that mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i want to here 's really not much spend time , except to say , we also to this area that will .
but this are all roads in the united states .
<unk> the top of <unk> picture of nasa .
they let us now something else out .
now that 's even live in the internet . you can it <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> , that really two different technologies together .
the a is <unk> and the other is a very good science about <unk> , of about <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> , <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research was done . a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it will of <unk> by .
you can see that , if we do this kind of views and create , we by images through , can and this experience the <unk> , which do .
but the spatial distribution of the is here in the fact , of .
the <unk> have these pictures together , lasted so you the real space , these images , all in near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies , were made , equal . you see here elements of stabilized slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in perspective in the relationship with each other , put it .
i do n't know , if i still time you have you very different environments to show .
there 's what , much spatialized to .
i wanted to look straight , the original of , noah needed to show and that 's a couple of the early prototype of <unk> , the we first time in summer have been working to that you try to show , what i think , it really the punch behind this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not so obviously , the environments at the things we the site .
we had the lawyers , . about .
this is a <unk> the cathedral notre dame , lady , the only in computers with images from flickr and after . give you just going to notre dame , lady in the flickr , and they will take pictures of men in the one and the <unk> , . get . each of orange <unk> represents a picture , that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so they 're doing this all <unk> , and they all stand in perspective on this way in the relationship with each other .
and we can on this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i 've never did , i ended up at microsoft , working with me .
i 'm very grateful for the inmates had this .
. i suspect , you can see , this many different kinds of cameras are , everything is , of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty big number of them , all in this environment me .
and when they can , i get some of weird to find .
many of you 're of their faces , with , .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , lady , the right recorded was .
we can of the poster to a physical view this environment .
the point is here , we do things with the social environment can do . it will now data of all gathered together -- of the entire of memory of the way , visually , the earth like -- and all going to each other .
all these photographs are going to each and it is something , that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model , that from around the earth .
at you this as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> , virtual earth .
and that 's something , that by the complexity , the people use it , growing and of use for the user interface with the application , is getting bigger .
their own photos , with metadata <unk> , a different person being .
if , somebody the trouble has done and all these fancy party with them , and becomes , who they 're all , my photo of the notre <unk> suddenly , with all these data , held and i can you as a point , in this space to scuba diving , in this <unk> , the photos of the other people use cells and a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of other players doing .
and of course , as all of these are the immense amounts of the virtual models of any interesting part of earth , not just by <unk> or a satellite and so , were , but through collective of memory .
thank you .
. i do you right ? their software to to a certain point , within the next few years , all images , of someone in the world together to be used , with linked to be ?
yes . they do anything else than to discover .
if you want you 've made you to hyperlinks , between the slides .
and they do this because of the content in the slides .
and that 's really exciting , if you , the amount of semantic information to think , many of these images .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they are enter and the the site of a lot of information about the picture is .
but how would it , if the image you with all their pictures connecting ?
then is the scope of semantic <unk> and the amount , it basically , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that 's amazing . congratulations .
they have a lot .
i 'm going to you some things from my book about the one , i hope , in unison with other things are the they already have heard . and i 'm trying to even a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't have noticed .
i want to the start , what i `` the official dogma binding . '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of western industrialized societies .
the official dogma in it 's so , if our target that to maximize the common our own citizens , is , about this , by the <unk> the freedom of individual .
the reason for this is , liberty in , it 's good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> principal requirement for the human .
when people to have , is about each of us for , the things to do , our public good as actually , and nobody has for us to decide .
the freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize returns .
the more choices , people have , more and more to have you . and the more to , they have , more than being have you .
this is , i think , so deep in our water ones , that 's not in the sense to get it would to ask questions .
and it 's also deeply in our lives rooted in .
i 'm going to you some examples of that give , which gives us modern economic progress that .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i just something about <unk> say .
there 's probably 175 <unk> in my local supermarkets , if you the 10 different extra <unk> n't <unk> and 12 <unk> the they buy it might be able to a big number , my own lettuce <unk> make , very case , not the 175 cases in the shop for you is true .
so that 's what the supermarket .
and then they go to the <unk> business to a good stereo at an -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , are . and in a surplus electronics business , there 's so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of different <unk> reason why i put out of the components , in a business of the time .
they have to admit that the a great variety is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there 's a time , when i was a boy , you could every phone supply have the you wanted , as he , ma bell who came .
they have your phone <unk> . they have n't it <unk>
a consequence of was , the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we now almost an infinite number of choice , phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
this are the mobile the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and they should that until now , not in your business have seen , you can be safe , it 's going to be .
and what it does is it brings people to stop in the business to walk and this question to imagine .
you know now what the answer this question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a phone to buy , that 's not to be much does .
in other aspects of life , very much more important than that buy one of personify things are , the same explosion of choices to .
health -- it 's not longer the case in the united states that , doctor , and the doctor says , you what to do .
instead they go to the doctor and the doctor says , you : why we have a to make or we have b .
a , has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what should i do ? ''
the doctor says , a , has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would , doctor , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it `` patient , autonomy . '' that sounds like a good thing , but in the reality is a shift the burden of responsibility for that make of making of someone something you know -- namely the doctor -- to the n't know , and probably sick is , and why not in the best constitution , is a choice to meet -- namely the patient .
there 's a tremendous marketing , <unk> drugs , for people , and me , that , if you think about , does n't make sense , because we do n't you buy .
why do gears for you to us , if we do n't can buy ?
the answer is : you expect of us the doctor in the next morning to call and to a change of prescription to ask them .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this is to .
we 'd not an identity , we invent you .
and we reinvent ourselves so often , how we want .
that is , that every day , if you the morning up , you need to make , for a kind of the person you 'll be like .
in terms on marriage and family , there 's a time , in the <unk> was , almost every one had and that you so fast were married , how they were , and then so fast as children got how they could .
the only true that election was `` who '' , when , and not what they do , we did .
now , everything is just to have .
i 'm teaching her wonderful intelligent students , and i leave you 20 percent less work as i used did .
and that 's not because they 're less sense are , and not because , carefully .
it 's because you with other things too are , you ask , `` i have to marry , or not ? should i now to marry ?
should i later , marry ? should i just have kids , or just a career i do ? ''
the 're all <unk> questions .
and they are these questions , regardless of them , whether that all the tasks to make the i do you <unk> and no good note in my class , to get .
and in the fact , you . and this are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl shows , with the technology is the us to every minute of every day of any place on the planet to work -- until the <unk> hotel .
there 's the way , a corner of the whole thing i did n't tell 'm going to , that <unk> works .
i 'm it does n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of the work harder choices to meet , and again , and again , whether we have to work or not have to work .
we can our children the football play watching , and we have our mobile phone , a hip , and our blackberry , other hip , and our laptop is probably going on our lap .
and also if you all off , are , every minute , we our child , <unk> of a soccer watching . we ask , `` i tried to this call would ?
i should be on this email somebody answers ? i tried to this letter writing ? ''
and also if the answer to the question `` no , '' is going to it certainly your experience of <unk> their child , cloaking them very different than it would have been .
everywhere , where we look , great things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world , we were actually saw this .
i want to say , there 's a few options , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world , we now live looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes . ''
we all know what good thing about it is , so i 'm about what 's bad thing about it 's .
all these choices we have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
a relativistic effect , <unk> way , is , he this , instead to be free .
with so many options out of the you choose can , it 's people very hard , even to decide .
i 'm going to a one <unk> example of that to have a study about investing in them <unk> .
a colleague of me had access the <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million u.s. employees and i think about . 2000 , very different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> the of employers who offered it , took the participation , two percent .
they provide 50 <unk> , -- 10 percent less and take part of as if you just five that would . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are the selection are , it 's so hard to decide what you choose to , it on the morning off .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's coming out of course never .
you know , that 's not just means , that people <unk> to eat , if you in the retirement , because they 're not enough money , on , have , it means also , that make decisions that hard is , big <unk> your employers who miss .
by the not participating in give you to around the u.s. dollars per year on the employer , the happy would have been their contribution to reproduce .
of this is a result of to many options .
and i think it makes for the world that looks .
they want to the decision really make , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment <unk> vote , or at the <unk> .
so this is the an effect . the other side effect is , even if we the lesion that and make a decision , the end we have less happy with the result of the selection , as if we the way i 'd have told us between the less ways to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is contingent upon by the great variety of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect imitation ? it 's simple , imagine you to a different decision to have can make the better would have been . and what happens is this is that an alternative to you to the decision to regret , and this regret that i 'm a negative impact on the average happiness , they of their impacts the work had , if it 's a good choice .
the more opportunities there 's , more and it 's it does nothing to regret that 's getting there for the election , they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> .
dan , gilbert , has a big point now this morning made by he was like , the way , we evaluate things , of it depends on to what we do it 's compare .
well , if it very much of alternatives to think there , it 's just , attractive properties to figure out of alternatives , they exclude them , that makes them less happy with the alternatives , they voted .
here 's an example . for the of them , no new york are , sorry i .
but here is , what they 're thinking about to .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous beach . great day . they have it 's all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' the man who thinks , `` it 's an august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood , is the way .
i could directly , my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the idea being that he the opportunity again , the day , one day , a great parking lot .
<unk> reduce the average happiness , we go through our choice , , also , if that what we chose to have been fantastic .
and the more opportunities to put it 's selection , there , more and more attractive properties of choice to be in the <unk> into account .
here 's a another example .
now , this cartoon , some statements .
he makes a statement about the right now to live and may also about things that slow to do .
but a very important point , he does is : always get to do for a thing to decide , you decide , other things not to do .
and these other things like many more attractive properties have , and it will , what they do n't be less motivator .
three : <unk> the expectations .
this , i met , when i my jeans and when we wanted .
i 'm jeans , almost all the time .
and there 's a time in the it just jeans is a way , and they have you bought , and they have a bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you long enough by and often enough clean had , you have started , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i went to new jeans , to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the sales , `` you want to greater , <unk> or of the place ?
you want to do buttons , or <unk> ? rock or the acid would clean ?
you want jeans , with holes ?
you want to the bottom , cut , <unk> , blah ... '' and so he told .
my jaw was down and after i started rebounding , i said , `` i have to the way , used to the only way . ''
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all these up and jeans <unk> , and spread the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best put jeans , i ever .
i had it better . all these large selection has made it me it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try it me , to understand .
the reason for instance , i got worse , i felt was , with all these technologies available ways , and expectations for , for a few jeans is , went up .
i was very low expectations . i did not a concrete expectations , as it you just in a kind there .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn , one of you have perfectly to be ,
and what i was very well , but it was n't perfect .
and so one i what i get had to the what i expected , and what i was getting there in comparison to the what i expected .
that 's add some of opportunities in the lives of people increases , they do the expectations of the people have about how well , these opportunities to be .
and this leads to less great satisfaction with the results , the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing do this . because , if you it would , we know , not what it 's about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , that used everything was better than all bad was , when all bad was , it was for the people to experience to make the a surprise .
now , in the world , we live -- we 're wealthy , one thing that citizens , perfection arises when i went -- the best for that you ever greater hope is it 's the things are so good as you do it of you expect .
they will never let 's surprised . because your expectations , and expectations , <unk> .
the secret to be concerned -- that 's what they all come are -- the secret to be concerned about are , have an expectation .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i do with a wife annie perasa married , i 'm , and they really is very beautiful .
i have it does n't do better . i did n't really began culturing .
but they preferred that 's not always been so a bad thing .
eventually , a result of <unk> a bad at recognizing jeans , if it just a way to buy there is , if you with these are , and you ask why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy a the there is , and they ask why , who is responsible for ?
it 's also realized that the answer the question is , you .
they have better fix it can do .
with a hundred different kinds of jeans is the windows , there 's no excuse for a mistake .
and so , when people make decisions , and also if the results make decisions are good , you feel , very disappointed about , they actually to themselves .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a pretty whopping -- not the only , but a pretty whopping <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also the suicide , is , people know you have the there are because their standards , so high . and then , if you these experiences , explain to , you think it would your fault .
and that 's <unk> that , we 're generally better about the objective , and we 're bad feeling .
so let me take you remember .
this is the official dogma binding yourself , that a that we all for really think , completely wrong . it 's not true .
there 's no question , that something that choice is better than no , but it follows are not the more selection is better than something that choice .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure , we need to that long as you have , the variety of our public good life .
now , as a policy question -- i 'm almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking about . that what these are choosing to the industrialized societies , is the material that wealth .
there 's many places in the world , and we have of a lot of you heard , their problem is not the to great variety is .
your problem is , to little bit .
so the things about the i 'm telling you 're an odd problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what 's so many frustrating and the date is : steve levitt , you briefly yesterday about telling how this is more and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm going to tell is , that this very expensive , complicated patient making -- it 's not just , that they do n't help .
they do n't actually hurt .
you care for that we got worse , there .
if something of what the people in our society and so decisions to come to the societies , where people to a choice 've shifted , would not only that life of people really improves , but we would also be improved .
economists call this is a <unk> application .
<unk> going to worry , it all the better about -- not just the poor -- because all these great variety of us an epidemic .
finally , read you please do this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it 's anything possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted , the world -- and that 's the kind of how i do it first i read .
the more , but thinking about , more and more i came to the view , that the fish , i know .
because the truth is , if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible , they have no freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible , down , the average happiness .
they increase the lesion , and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with one of security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely for us .
but that <unk> be of a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for the misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of projects are already been talked about is the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of groups of genes .
actually start , we of a new point , we have the biology and digitized , and now we try the digital code in a new phase of biology to get by we new life create , and to .
we 've always trying to great questions to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , what i think , many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it until the minimum of the components to simplify them .
we have almost 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> have sequenced it was really , the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world , the computer .
now we 're trying to be asking whether we live regenerate , or whether we new life create , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of species of the , in a self-replicating . and we tried to see if we that with a still a smaller genome , you can achieve .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to give up of the 500 or so , here .
but if we do this is metabolic map at the very simple is , in comparison to our . trust me , that 's too . but if we all these genes you look at the we one after the other than elimination can it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell capacity to would .
so we 've determined that , the only way to jump forward is this pair chromosome in fact , to synthesize , what allows us the top of the components to <unk> and some of the fundamental question to imagine .
and so we started , with the question , we have a chromosome , synthesize that ?
what it 's the chemistry , this really big molecule to what 's still never before was done ?
and , if we can do that , we can that chromosome start ?
a chromosome , is that way , just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our first steps at the very high-res digitization , of life were growing exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write , very slowly developed , but nevertheless , increased . and our last point would now on an exponential curve , put them .
we 've got 15 years ago , so i started .
it actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review , before we the first experiments did .
like , turned out there 's <unk> very difficult .
there 's tens of machines , around the world , the little pieces of dna can make , 30 to 50 letters for but it 's a <unk> process , so the longer you a piece of power , the more fatal mistake to happen .
so we had a new way to come up with the we these little pieces together and the error correct the minds .
that was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 countries .
it 's a virus of bacteria , kill .
we created little pieces , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting to the came when we do this piece <unk> chemical and in a bacterium , gave , and that bacteria and the genetic code to read and made a viral particles .
the viral them were then the cells that would and came back and killed , e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> talked and they said , this model , figure out .
they were laughing , you it here does .
so we think that the a situation is in the software , the your hardware we can build in a biological system .
but we wanted , a lot go on . we want a whole <unk> chromosome , building . it has more than <unk> letter of genetic code . so we wanted , we build it in it on the size of the virus , what we need the size it <unk> were able to understand what the top of the components of living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in the computer to want to these digital access information , really way to be .
when we the genome for the first in 1995 , have sequenced it was the <unk> at a mistake per 10,000 base .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence that used to have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of the it 's the pieces to the 50 letters for are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap to be able to get smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a huge amount of here into .
you might have heard that we <unk> into .
you think about after , we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids , and here 's a single one of what matters for each of amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using to our words to to write sentences , thoughts .
initially we only signed .
some people were quite disappointed about that 's not enjoy poetry was .
we have the pieces constructed so that we just want you with enzymes into the minds . there are enzymes , this repair and to stitch back .
and we 've started pieces to create , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> letters in terms , added these other , to <unk> to do to this back into , to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces , we have produced by that we do you sequence we could , because we looked at a very robust process to create what you in a minute going to see .
we tried to point of <unk> to get .
so , that looks out of like a <unk> .
if we now , really big dance pieces of getting -- with about 100,000 over -- then , this is not just in e. coli that grow . it up all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so as well , we other policy mechanisms to .
we know , from a mechanism of <unk> recombinations is called the the biology is used to disrupt dna to fix , these pieces together .
here 's an example of them . there 's a large organism , called <unk> <unk> the three million ] bike , radiation , fine .
you see the top of the field that chromosome , just slightly apart .
12 to 24 hours later , which , everything again , together like it was .
we have thousands of organisms do that can .
these organisms that can totally <unk> , you can even in a vacuum .
i 'm absolutely make sure that live in space there , and you can move , the search , <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that 's a lot of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by we these are used to have -- actually , we just <unk> used to the right design the pieces we have you <unk> . yeast into these then automatically .
that 's no <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
so it 's a big molecule , we do it even with the <unk> can see .
that are the images about a whole duration of six seconds .
this is the <unk> the we just recently finished have asked .
that are about <unk> letters , hiding the code . it 's the largest molecule , <unk> structure that ever of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of about 300 million .
if we do it with a <unk> of 10 and without the distances of print one would it would <unk> pages from just to this genetic code <unk> .
now , how to start , we have a chromosome 7 ? how we activate it ?
it 's obviously , it with a virus , very simple . it 's much more complicated with bacteria to deal .
it 's as much easier if you do it in <unk> how we do it are doing , you just take the nucleus out and there is a other into , and that is that 's exactly what they all the results of cloning .
at <unk> is that chromosome in the cell into but recently , we 've shown to you have a complete a year and one pair chromosome from one cell to the other can make and these are .
we <unk> that chromosome one <unk> . speaking , are two , as far from how humans , mice . we gave some <unk> to so we do this pair chromosome , select group were . we <unk> it with what enzymes , all the proteins to destroy themselves . and it was very amazing when we do it in a cell , gave -- and they 're going to our very <unk> 're here we estimate --
the new synthetic chromosome out went in the cell .
in fact , we thought , here the end is , but we tried the process , on to .
this is the <unk> the evolution .
we find all kinds of species here , a second chromosome taken , or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of those in just a second to a species <unk> .
people so , evolution can imagine , as a gene that to a moment changed that will have a lot of the biology is missing .
there 's that the <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has n't ; the chromosomes , we put them have already .
it was in the cell <unk> and i realized that other synthetic chromosome , when someone material <unk> it and so we had the end just a cell with a new synthetic chromosome .
it <unk> , blue , because of the genes , we put them .
and after a very short time , it was all the characteristics of species forever lost and <unk> completely in a new species , based on the new software , we in the cell have given .
all the proteins and changed , the membranes and changed , -- as we the genetic code to read , it was that 's exactly what we 're transferring aid .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by we the <unk> here , things quite dramatic change .
now i argues , that this is not the <unk> is -- that 's based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argues that we possibly , are a new kind of the cambrian explosion to create in the it 's massive whole new <unk> based on this digital media design might be .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty clearly in terms on what we need .
we are , of six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
now , it in my connection to ask : i was , in 1946 , born .
today are three people on this planet for every one of the year from 1946 , has ; , 40 years , it 's four be .
we have problems with food , with all-natural fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it is a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that are a hundred million barrels of the day .
if we 're talking about the biological processes to think , or any process to bring that replace , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's the co2 from this material that in the end up .
we now , from our discoveries from the world , a database , about 20 million of genes , and i want to believe that these the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and you see , the diversity , it was .
we and here in the firing line , the biological reality and , those of our idea .
we now technologies of these rapid <unk> the three to do what we <unk> genetics .
we now the possibility of a robot to build the millions of chromosomes , the day , make it can .
if you imagine those 20 million of genes to make or these redundant processes to optimize the octane make or drugs new vaccines , we can get on the only a small team , a molecular biology to change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can use to <unk> <unk> , one of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
that 's a tape of everyone <unk> , we work , you actually sit down and new species on the computer to design <unk>
you know , we know , not about how it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code looks like this is .
we focus . fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn to be ethanol , what 's just a bad tv experiment .
we switch fuels the <unk> and third generation of the relatively soon as if the much higher <unk> have to the octane fuel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way to biology is a big impact , another spike in the cost on food or the limitation of their having will have is , if we co2 as starting material can see , and therefore , we work , cells , this way ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 emissions are a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we all kinds of different ways .
that 's an organism , we 1996 , described .
he lives in the deep , <unk> miles deep , at virtually <unk> <unk> .
it into carbon in the methane , under the use of hydrogen as energy .
we study whether we <unk> co2 we can use , which simply to <unk> to be able to convert that co2 in the fuel cell to this process to power .
within a short four-year time , we think , we could be in the be able to a sort of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we really -- <unk> goals , like the nutritional substitute the petrochemical industry . exactly what if you that 's not at ted i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy .
but as we work currently , the same kind of for the vaccines to speak .
they have it this year with the flu seen , we 're always a year in the back on and have a dollar to little bit , if it to the right vaccine .
i think that the be changed , by you <unk> vaccines , in sufficient .
that 's the future , possibly could look up with changes , can now the <unk> up to be with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps some <unk> .
we are light years of the people to improve . our goal is it just , we have a chance long enough to survive , that potentially to do . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i was a little introduction to the lhc .
and i agreed back to come to me to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so here . and for all those the time , not there were , the lhc is the science experiment , which you ever went on was -- 27 more miles in diameter .
his job is it , the conditions to create , which fewer than a <unk> second , after the universe that they were -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just so ambitious .
this is the machine , below , geneva .
we take pictures of <unk> in the detectors on .
, i work . he called , an atlas off the detector , of feet in the breadth continued , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of an atlas off in the construction , so you the scale .
the 10 . september the last year was the machine , the first time .
and this picture was of an atlas .
it was making huge <unk> in the room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the way to the lhc <unk> , then , with a part of the lhc <unk> to a rain of particles in the detector <unk> to happen .
in other words , as we took this at 10 . september they saw , we knew that the machine works , what a huge victory .
i do n't know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , this , when someone the google side that i went and the front page , so i found .
it means , we have a cultural influence to the science of trade .
about a week later , there 's a problem with the machine , which with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires .
those wires , run <unk> <unk> when the machine on <unk> .
now the engineers , you will you look at and say , `` no , that they do n't . that are small wires . ''
you can that could afford , because if you very far cooling , they going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , those wires in the tension and endurance .
in the connections , between about <unk> magnet inside the lhc , there 's a <unk> .
it would have heating , the wires , slightly and <unk> <unk> met and suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .
so , that everything is still a wonderful when you imagine , that the magnet about 20 tons weigh , and , about . 30 inches , shifted .
we were so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> it , <unk> you .
they 're now all over again on their way back .
against the end of the march , the lhc switches back <unk> be .
we 're going to him turn , and expect the first data in june , or maybe july , collect to tell , and put our journey on , to see what the building blocks of the universe .
now , of course , on a way to stir some of these accidents , again , the debate to value of the science and <unk> , such planetary boundaries . it 's easy , it .
i think the fact that 's so hard is , the fact that we 're talking about our planetary boundaries out to grasp , is the value of things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my final element words in english scientist to me , humphrey <unk> , the one , i suspect , when he was the most useless experiments , of <unk> defended us to be a student was michael <unk> , this , `` nothing is that dangerous for the evolution of human spirit , when i assume , our scientific ideas on are , that 's no mysteries in the nature , there , our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to china is there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
to write books is my profession , but it 's kind of course , more than that .
it 's also my big , lifetime of love and fascination .
and i do n't expect to the ever change .
however , is a recent something weird in my life and my career has happened , that me to it has brought to my terms , at this work , to rethink .
this to unify the incident was , i recently wrote a book of have -- a biography called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- , that , decided , all my previous books from that for some in the world beyond us and a <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is , they said , matter where i come to treat it 'll be as i the <unk> <unk> .
seriously -- the <unk> <unk> !
for example , you very concerned on me , and say , if you do n't you to this success never by going ?
they have no fear , before , all their lives <unk> and never again a book , create , that anybody in the world in this ? never again ? ''
okay , that makes it really the courage .
it would be however , even worse , when i 'm not remember it would , they said , about 20 years , when i was a teenager , the first time . i told , writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> response been faced .
the people said , were you 're not afraid , never succeeded versus to have ?
you no fear , you the humiliation of rejection one ?
you no longer afraid you to this craft , your life for <unk> and it never something , and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams are dying , going -- your mouth with the bitter dregs of ash into the failure ? ''
so about , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on all these questions is : <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid , all these things .
and the year i always .
and i ago , a lot more of fear , no <unk> would .
how algae , and other <unk> things .
but if it 's about writing about , i 've been recently , about , and ask me : why ?
that 's wife ?
it 's logical , of someone to be , he , before , the work to do to the he , you get to feel ?
and what exactly the creative , there was going on you to us into uncertainty about the other <unk> do -- in a way , how it other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can tell me , not a situation in his own 40 years as a chemist , remember , in the he was asked , if he was afraid to have , chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how it 's hear you that ?
it was just not ago , you know ?
but to be fair to be -- the group of a chemist who have about the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we who seem , but this kind of the reputation . but not just the writer , but the creative of genres , seem like this call to have mental , he 's unstable .
everything , what they need to do , is , the bitter <unk> of really great the head just go out of 20 . century , at the young and often of their own hand , died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> the tracks of their talents to really used to have been to be .
norman <unk> said , just going on his death in his last job interview , <unk> my books , i was a little bit further <unk>
an extraordinary point , you about her work , can do .
but we shrug our n't even if we find somebody something that tell you hear , because we of these statements for so long time . somehow we have the notion that level , and collectively accepted , creativity and i 'm sorry , kind of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- always to <unk> leads .
the question , i now any here to ask you want is : is this idea for you completely in order ?
you feel , so i guess ? because with just a tiny inch by looking at -- i feel with this notion do n't think .
i think they really .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i do n't want to watch , the next century , taken .
i think it better , if we did the creative encourage the city .
and i know definitely , it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to be able to start , this dark path of a hunch , <unk> -- especially in the situation that , i fell in my career , am .
that means -- you see , i 'm pretty too young . i 'm just ca . 40 years old .
i may still another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely , everything , what i from now , going to write the world as the work they will , after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it comes straight , because we 're here , now all of friends -- it 's highly , my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , for a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts , somebody to do n't , to nine o'clock in the morning to go , <unk> to drink . and that i did n't .
i 'd continue this work to do , i love .
so this is the question : how ?
eventually , the <unk> seems to me , they said , to continue to write , a kind of <unk> psychological ones are building design must .
somehow i have to from now , find a way , the can write a safe distance to real disjunction between me and my very natural <unk> about how to the response on the very well-written will be .
while i in the last year after the models for looking to have the three to do , i also in the past , for and i tried to other societies have to find out to see , if you might better or <unk> ideas about it had as we , creative can help , with the emotional risks to deal , with the creativity to them .
this for led me into the old greece and the old , rome .
please follow me , because the circle is , again .
but in the old greece and rome have the people did n't believe , creativity of people coming , okay .
they thought , creativity is a kind <unk> <unk> was , from a distant , of the source to the people coming -- from <unk> , of reasons .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known , he it who believed , he had a <unk> , he wisdom from on the distance , which .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> .
that 's great . the roman we do n't really , a genius , in very clever which was .
they thought , a genius , this kind magical <unk> beings who was that we did was , it literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- so how <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists in the work of invisible <unk> and the result of design would .
that 's brilliant , there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological ideas are building , you look at the follow your work to protect .
and everybody knew that , so it , right ?
the artists of <unk> was going on certain things are protected , like , for example , to a lot <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant was they were , you 're not all look for you <unk> . everybody knew you to this <unk> genius did , that you helped .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely , your mistakes .
everybody knew , your genius , was something <unk> .
so we have the people in the west really long time about creativity that .
and then the renaissance and all changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let us that human individual into the center of the universe , imagine -- about all the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , for the unicorn defenses are creatures , the commands by the divine .
it 's the rational idea of humanism , and the people began to believe that the creativity , from their own individual who came .
the first time in the story , you can hear people , or those artist , a genius call -- instead of them , he 's a genius .
i must tell you : i think , that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a sensation merely one person to allow me , and he thinks , he or she was like that 's been the pelvis and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , unknown , an mystery is a little tiny , too much responsibility to you a <unk> , human psyche , even more .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
the most disfiguring cancer , and distorted by the ego and it all these <unk> expectations , the success .
i think that the <unk> our artists , the last 500 years <unk> .
and , if that 's true , -- and i think , it 's true -- is the question :
we go to change ?
maybe to a <unk> understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative back .
maybe not .
maybe we that <unk> from 500 years , rational idea of humanism , not just in a <unk> talk , and eradicate world .
and there 's certainly affecting people in this audience , really fair , it 's register , you about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , . apply them .
i 'm probably not all of them on this journey , you can take .
but the question , i letting you want is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it makes as much sense like all other that i heard of have , if it was never about , absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> the creative process to understand .
a process , the , -- like everyone knows , it ever tried , something to make -- so in other words , actually , here -- not always been properly acts .
in the fact , he can , sometimes it <unk> feel .
i had recently , that encounter such as i the extraordinary american beat poet <unk> stone , the well over 90 is , but all their lives for a poet . they told me , when you in <unk> virginia up out on the fields , working . they said , they would feel and you can hear like a poem from the landscape on you <unk> .
they said it would like a <unk> move from the air ,
of the country , they <unk> would .
they felt , if it , because it would the earth , under their feet , <unk> bring .
you know , in such a moment , just one could do . and that was -- in their words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil , house while they of this poem that was being . it was only about you to quickly enough to a paper and a pen to get to , so you it , if it , you through <unk> to capture and the sheet on could .
at another painting was n't you fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they reached the house , and the poem would weave through you through and you missed it . they said it would go on the country to try and -- how they said -- <unk> a other , <unk> .
and then there 's these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- they said , it moments , there , where you let 's almost missed .
so , they 're running for the house and looking after the paper and the poem <unk> , you through and you , and a just as it , they <unk> and then -- i said , you -- it was so when i would with their other hand , we reach and it to get .
they got the poem , his tail and it back in your body and it 's took on the paper .
in these times that came the poem and justly , and intact , the paper , -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i think that i thought i `` this is an incredible -- that 's exactly how to my creative process <unk>
that 's actually do n't like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to can i have to every day , the same time up and sweat , i struggle and really , right <unk> .
but even i in my <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess , many of you that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas , from a source , by me <unk> , i really do n't identify you can .
what is that for a thing ?
and how to we do with in the relationship , about our minds to lose , but for us to the even in mental health to hold ?
for me is the living for example , this can actually create the musician , tom <unk> . i had to him a few years ago for a magazine interview .
we talked about that about this . and you know what ? of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of jostling modern artist , trying to this <unk> creative pulses , in him <unk> , to control and with them getting .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me , he 's one day on a <unk> in go to los angeles went . and there , everything changed for him .
he went with high speed as he suddenly , a fragment of tune , you hear the , how it at inspirations are often is , for him <unk> hard is tangible . and he wants you have . you is gorgeous . he <unk> then , but he can you ca n't .
he has not a piece of paper , he has n't a pen , he has no recorders .
he begins , this old <unk> in him up , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm from this song on forever being able to be .
i 'm not good enough , i do it ''
but rather than in out to get out , he heard just on .
he ended up all the <unk> and did something completely new .
he looked at just in the sky and said , <unk> , you ca n't see , the car to drive ? ''
<unk> i , when i could just a song assume ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , again , when i 'm going to you care can .
if not , <unk> today , somebody else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
be whole <unk> , after that changed .
not the work itself . the was to say , so dark matter how they said , and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , it is , was salvaged when he was that of a genius , it took , where he 's nothing more than the trouble the shape and it to the betrayal , where he sort came from . he realized that , no <unk> , <unk> thing had to be .
it was a strange beasts , miraculous , bizarre , working to have a kind of conversation and tom , and the <unk> , <unk> thing , that 's not , tom 's been .
when i do this story of you have changed it also a bit of the way , i worked and it has me , even have saved .
this idea that saved me as i engaged in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . i fell in a this simply dug the have in the we all the fall , if we , something to work and it does n't . you <unk> , to think , that 's a disaster . that is the worst sketch artist book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started to think , i should the project , just <unk> .
but then i remembered that , like tom 's the theme of heaven i 've had and i tried it .
i took so my travels at the manuscript , and talked my comment , of empty the corner of a room .
i spoke out loud , `` stop , you thing , you and i know , both , if this book , brilliant , is , it 's not completely my fault , is , right ?
because you see , yes , everything , what i , <unk> . i did n't even more than that .
if you get it so much better have to , you got here show up and your of the deal , all .
okay . but , if you do n't do -- you know what , the devil with it .
i 'm still further , because that 's my job .
and i want , protocol , there , today for my part of jobs here , scraping
because -- the end it 's how to follow . centuries ago , have , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred and music and music spanning around , for an initiation ceremony has been -- to <unk> .
this fixed prices were always been great , because the dancer who were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but , and again , very rare , was special . of the performer , was actually <unk> .
and i know , you know , what i mean , because i know , all in your life , once , such a performance , have seen .
it was when i would have the time <unk> and the dancer walks through a kind of a doorway to . he did n't know , he 's ever before has done -- a thousand nights earlier . but everything on , together .
and very suddenly appeared he did n't know , no longer in human .
he was from up and of the bottom up and everything is lit , through a <unk> fire .
as something that time , what happened to know the people what was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
that is god , you know ?
interesting historic footnote : when the <unk> <unk> cetaceans they brought this practice . the way it changed , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still , <unk> and <unk> hear .
if a performer , in spain , <unk> , something magic has done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> world , there is it , a glimpse at the god .
and that 's great , because we need that .
but the tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancer , up and recognize that , 11 o'clock in every tuesday -- is -- and he did n't no longer a <unk> of god in , wearing .
he 's just a premature aging mortal self with <unk> at . and maybe he will never again , with rising up .
and perhaps will never again , god 's name out , when he said , you . but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
that 's a the <unk> done some of creative life .
but maybe it must not very , of their anguish , be , if you of the beginning , we did n't have the most critical aspects of being , of them , it .
if you might just think , a loaner are -- of an export source for a <unk> time your life , the , somebody else being , if you 've done with .
if we start , so think about , that changes everything .
so i started to think , and so i think with safety in the past few months , while i , the book working , that soon , is -- as the dangerous to contemplate the strong to really <unk> my <unk> success .
what i always , even need to say , when i talk about this crazy 'm going , is : i did n't afraid .
she was n't feeling disheartened .
just do your job .
she was going to continue for your contribution , what that he may be .
if your job that dance is , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , that you the side asked to decide , for a moment , yet , miracles through your effort to show , <unk> ! ''
and if not , i 'm dancing and yet , your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you , despite all .
i think , and i feel that , we should that teach .
<unk> ! '' for you , despite all , just for you to the mere human love and the <unk> did , that there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these slides just showed up to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , close , three million years of the size of the bottom of 48 states had to 40 percent down .
but this back there 's not be strong enough to the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thick of ice .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
they grow in winter and -- in summer .
the next slide , i 'm going to show , is a <unk> what in the last 25 years happened .
that <unk> is with the red , a .
how you see , it 's on the blue , drag . this is the year by ice in the wintertime ; and it -- in summer .
that 's called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which of the body , here <unk> .
in 25 years , it from here , here to be gone .
this is a problem , the warming the frozen reason to the arctic ocean <unk> , it big discoveries of , <unk> carbon , there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes , methane , which is .
compared with the whole puzzling , <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could , this amount double , if we have this critical point that cross .
already today <unk> in some and lakes in alaska and methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska , of another task to a other and lake last winter time traveling .
wow !
you about it . the question is , how would have to us <unk> .
and a reason is , this enormous amount of heat up with the greenland from the north .
this is a year <unk> .
but the volume , are much larger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know what the heavens through <unk> up here <unk> into the ocean .
these are rivers , rapidly to .
the other end of the planet , the west antarctica , the biggest mass on the planet .
last month up and researchers that the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> the a few <unk> up is , especially hard and the melting .
this is 20 a level , the greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> mass , you see the top of lakes , the years ago , a few years glaciers were .
40 percent of people in the world get the half of their <unk> , draining snowmelt from .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this city .
the as well have , <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in the <unk> the sierra seen .
this in terms of the <unk> .
and the predictions , you read have , are seriously .
this <unk> in the world that leads to a dramatic increase , fire .
and the catastrophe , around the world have in a really <unk> and before i never an unprecedented degree gained .
four times , so many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of , you see , what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced , 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
you look , the the eastern pacific , right , from the continent the west , and both the indian <unk> , where it 's a drastically decline of oxygen in the ocean there .
the biggest single factor for the global warming , next to logging , 20 percent is what is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are a sort of the largest <unk> , along with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change .
here are the , in the last few years , painted , , with some green are alternatives , proposed .
<unk> there 's a political , they in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to apply to , in fact , a contradiction in , is .
this reminded me , something .
the christmas around them off , at me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> in the news .
this is in our whole country in the <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to the christmas .
one of the commercials , the <unk> , christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy -- .
it 's in the shell and plenty in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and the workers to stay in wages , and the bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in west virginia .
the most <unk> is the ladder of massey coal .
they let me a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't know , what they talk .
so , the alliance for <unk> two to the life was launched .
this is a , a part of her .
the <unk> we see the climate change , as a serious at risk for our business .
so we have it gives us to the top <unk> put them , a significant <unk> spending to a <unk> on the way to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not much .
we think , she 's clean -- and it also still good .
so , to do n't worry about the climate .
leave you the quiet for us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot of .
so , let us a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal of the main reasons for the global warming is the remarkably , clean <unk> , you see here , changes everything .
you look at it , right , this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally woke up , the positive alternative , with our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread , this all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> like the dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a courageous , new solution to us from this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america with 100 percent cleaner , electricity , , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to get to us safer to make and to help the global warming continues to stop .
finally , a solution , the big enough is , our to solve problems .
<unk> america in new . they get more out .
this is the last thing .
it 's going to a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way of , our dependence of the old , diapers <unk> , our world one , to .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new system .
new investments to well , paid for jobs to create .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an old african saying : `` if you quickly want to be able to go alone .
if you very far come to get off , get together . ''
we need to go far come , and it quickly .
thank you .
so i want you start to ask , the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized , the hands out and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , they learned in fact , to think , and problems through the understanding and change spatialized what 's going to solve .
that handles spacial think is closely with being connected , how we have a lot of our environment to understand .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real word objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i began to wonder : what would , if we use computers would , instead of <unk> , the , like a digital <unk> on a start to tie these moves -- what would , if we do with both hands intervene could and data , physically , who and they so this could , how we do it want ?
this question was so really , we need to study of the answer to and <unk> .
short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can with the hand be moved , you , they 're able to you can your movement to capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
so much more importantly , are are physically , why you how to convert them just by that reach the hands and one can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> , and a consciousness for your movement to develop , each of see , and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we do with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll start with some simple example .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , the video went ahead of one ; if i asked him in the other <unk> , it does it backwards .
and this interactive for portraits , here , each other .
if i do you so next to put , and that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , notice they that , and we can do something very nervous .
and they feel as their movements and the propensity .
a really interesting , the interactions , we need to see it started , was , we sort of the gestures on the data to be , how about color so to them into education , this with <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can you use to color in the in the middle to pour , then mixed up .
if we do it carried , we have a little <unk> .
there 's also , some kind of opportunities in the education , how many languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we people the possibility of the rapid <unk> give and the right to see .
i 'm here -- that 's a fibonacci numbers , i do with a simple <unk> draw .
that 's a game with words , that a kind of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically , you get any of on every <unk> , <unk> letters and while you 've tried the words to form , this talk about a dictionary to report .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back up and you has a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids , on a trip to the media lab up . i could you to move , it and you have a video of them .
they have it really loved .
a more interesting that looked at this kind of applications is , you to the people not a lot of them to give them .
all of what you need to say is `` it used words , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a few people , it test .
that 's our youngest <unk> down there right .
it turned , out , he the <unk> just a pile .
so for him , they were just to convert .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we want a powerful tool for <unk> develop .
that 's <unk> .
he can create new characters in the scene , actionable , by he the <unk> the pick , this figure shows .
here , he the sun is an .
the sun goes on
now speeding up he 's a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good work . yes !
by he the <unk> shake and they 're together , put he can the characters and interact and let me ...
and his own story to invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , how they developed .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that i now time you 've seen , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> , that we recently have evolved and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , singing and the drums operate .
each has four different variations ; you can choose , which you to use .
and you can these sounds in the sequence -- if , you again in any of accessing it can .
and you <unk> you a , by you just a <unk> , a <unk> holding .
there are the effects , you live , we can change , like . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound , and it 's him and then , hiring .
and then , the overarching effects , like the speed and the volume , you on the entire sequence that gets .
so , let me .
we start , we the <unk> in two <unk> -- and this in a series of the way , they expand and a little bit more the voice to it .
now i 'm i have a bass , it .
now i 'm still something like drums .
and now just hook , the filter , like drums , so i the effect of live with taxes .
i can the entire sequence of the speed , by now , at the , or other direction <unk> .
and now just hook , the filter , with the bass , for something more expression .
i can the sequence , as you 're going to change .
and i have to do n't you in the reservations are planning , but you truly improvising ; they all this is prolong or from .
and finally , in the entire sequence <unk> , by i the <unk> to left 've .
thank you .
how so , you can see , is my desire for , new <unk> to the better to the fit , like our brains and body work .
and today , i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities of going to show , what we in our lab to work .
the idea , i them with the way to give you want , is that we , the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to the interaction with digital media are the information in our world to the our demands that .
thank you ,
i 'm on the conversations with you all .
