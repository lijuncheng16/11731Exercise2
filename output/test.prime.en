when steve lopez , funny , go to los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of go to los angeles , i see , he heard a wonderful music .
they came from a man , a heavily african-american , <unk> , somewhere , are homeless , on a violin and playing the only still two strings , had .
many of you 're going to the story know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , that again , a movie was , robert <unk> junior varsity when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> school , and of very promising career , sadly very early by his paranoid schizophrenia , was ended .
nathaniel left the juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living he as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or , the film at , so they 're not just the wonderful connected to understand , between these two men that is , but also the music , this is linked to make it and how they finally the instrument was , if this pun allows is , that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i 've <unk> in the years in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a performance of <unk> first , and fourth symphony of and came from behind the stage , to , i imagine .
he talked in a very <unk> and the side of clay , about the yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about how to the dodgers abandoned it never going to the baseball world series do you . and that all because the <unk> passage of the first violin at the last sentence of <unk> fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music to talk . and a few days later i have an email , in the was , nathaniel , for <unk> , i was interesting .
i must have you say , nathaniel a medical treatment <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> been treated , a trauma , that it be whole life being .
as a result of that he is now , particularly prone for these schizophrenic stages . the 're sometimes that bad , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , always in horror and the <unk> his own mind to .
and in just as a <unk> was , nathaniel , as we do with our first started , walt disney <unk> hall started . he had this . flickering in his eyes and it seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and about how to him , someone in their sleep and poison .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid , i told him lose it could , he in a bit of the conditions into the process , and that i 'm going to its relationship to a violin at destroying it could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and other exciting prospect of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so simple , to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed on , in <unk> eyes a full of change ago , went .
it was , as if he taped underneath the impact of an invisible to reach them was , a chemical in response , of the catalyst of my game .
<unk> <unk> rage and turning , understanding , in a quiet for curiosity and this is immensity required .
and how through a miracle , he took his violin and began to be heard some clips of <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then , about music to talk , started out of the stream , beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other protocell b , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i was clear , he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with you also a process of personal relationship connected .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding , that anything else i just one of my colleagues in the philharmonic , go to los angeles , i know .
by his music playing and about music , talking , was , <unk> , confused man , the way that , by the streets of go to los angeles moved there was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the juilliard <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and intractable delusions , help his imagination and creativity in something real to aspire .
and so <unk> he , who 's being .
i understood , exactly this the essence of art is .
exactly this is the reason , why we music to do : so we do something , that in us all the deep in the inside of us is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually made shapes .
and the fact that expression , all of us , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music got it back in a family of musicians , it mind , be a talent and realized , and it raised hands .
and i 'm going , with nathaniel music , no matter whether , walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me , why i musicians to become 'm .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want something to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope , pardon me .
so i have in my life , many fishes as well known .
i just two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a fish , <unk> , good it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> after the the highest standards of sustainability , seeing .
you could so , probably feel about that , it to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a relationship , several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and said , if i in an event , which could about the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company , the ability to trying to this incredible this problem for us chefs . how to keep we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years we the ocean out how we forests <unk> beaten up .
it 's hard to the destruction began to <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , the , we love , abundant , the <unk> , the <unk> , this swordfish , they 're totally collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so this is , or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many of arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are needed to you a pontoon of <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
it tastes , not very good .
so here was finally , a company , trying to it right .
i wanted to support .
the day , the event , i called the head of <unk> for the company .
we call him , don .
`` well , don brownlee , '' i said , `` only to the facts , right to have , you are famous for , so far out in the sea , to grow , you the environment is not being polluted water . ''
`` that 's true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste from fish and distributed , not focused . ''
and then put he 's add , `` we 're in basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what she told her ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great . '' , i said . put on .
and , that night i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , briefly , the event , don .
i said , don brownlee , for instance , are sustainable proteins right ? ''
he said , he got into the world . he 'll ask folks .
now , i get on with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a this answer , until i finally , senior fellow biologists on .
we call him as well , don .
`` well , don brownlee , '' i said , `` what the example are sustainable proteins right ? ''
now , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , putting feathers to the skin , <unk> , that , <unk> and to forage and processes . ''
i said , `` how much of living person consume it 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don brownlee , what 's sustainable , grilled chicken , fish to feed ? ''
there 's a break in the line and he said , `` there 's just to a chicken , the world . ''
i <unk> me of this fish .
no , not , because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> 'm .
that i even .
no , i <unk> actually of this fish <unk> , because , i swear , god , the fish , sort of entertainment , chicken , tasted star .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of year-old .
it 's the romantic sort of the way , you , ever better if you his fish , learns , you the fish the more love .
i told him first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been thinking about this fish about .
well , we kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing in the white color .
the chef who had him <unk> .
, twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can a fish that well taste , let me , after he <unk> was ?
i can do n't it , but this guy can it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he says jose miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish ca n't a cook and he 's not a chef . at the way , you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist , <unk> la <unk> .
that 's a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
you is near the <unk> the river <unk> .
to the 1980s , was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> the , what , the wetlands .
they did that , putting the country <unk> .
they built this complicated result of sewers , and they had urged her water from the land out and out into the river .
now , they could n't make , that was fine , not forwards economically .
and ecologically . it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds , what for this place , many birds are .
and so , in a spanish company with green the country .
what you have done ?
they have the river in the water rushing around .
they have literally the lever <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> they the the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , completely around .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and everything what you 're <unk> channels and these are dense , into the march .
i was there , not long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? there we were and she fought alongside us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been on to my travels at , and miguel holding in peace , <unk> .
here up and he 's a rare <unk> .
now i mentioned , he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , see here he 's a pattern of the pool , that it , <unk> giraffe , remember .
it turns , out to miguel the most of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , he said , so a <unk> .
he said , `` fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm an expert , relationships . ''
and then is he and over , more hearing from the world , birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and , do n't let me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was going to be about this <unk> piece <unk> fish , that i the brink had .
so i put it <unk> . i said , `` miguel , how it , your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , that 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your built-in fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he <unk> on me to share that 's a rich system is that the fishes better food , in the wild , you .
the more vegetable biomass , and phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fishes as an .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
the moment of a farm heard , their animals not an ant ?
later on the day i went on this site , miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , so , seems to be , '' different than any rural farm , the i ever been was , `` how to measure , you are succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> to have .
and we must bow to the corner and we provided , the most sight , thousands and pinker flamingos , literally , pinker carpet and so far the eye , it .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look you , their bellies on earth , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely overwhelmed .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're losing $ 20 percent of our fish and <unk> , the birds .
now the last year we were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 different types .
it 's now the largest and one of the private <unk> , europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last , that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he kept shaking his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a , who network .
the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
you , pinker looks so the belly and more than the system . ''
okay , they let us that i think again . a farm , their animals not an and a farm , their success , the health of her to measure .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to this flamingos , first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the evaporated and better , it 's <unk> .
every morning to fly you are 240 miles to farm .
and every night fly , they are 240 miles back .
they do that , because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a kind of the journey of the penguins had imagined , so at i miguel sokoloff .
i said , `` miguel , fly , they are 240 miles to the farm and fly you are 240 miles back on the evening ?
they do that for the children ? ''
he looked me , when i just a song of the whitney houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that , because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the skin of my beloved of the fish , the most delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking , almost never going to work .
and yet , when i do you in this restaurant in <unk> one of have the ant does n't even after <unk> tasted star .
they did sweet and in , as if you a half bites by the ocean , would .
i mentioned that , miguel , and he take naps every time .
he said , `` the skin does like a swam .
you is the last <unk> , until something in the body , you .
you , over the evolution has evolved to <unk> suck . ''
and then put he 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , your fish do n't an . a farm , their success is measuring the success of its predators .
and then i was , when he says , a farm , no <unk> , <unk> he really big , because the water , that through this farm will come from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things , leads , of rivers , to tend to you , to lead , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it spreading through the system , fighting , and this , it 's the waters clean , how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , their animals not an , not just a farm , their success , the health of her to measure , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i guess it , and that they should also do , because these year-old , romantic , that , is also telling .
you might say , a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food aid actually good taste .
but for many people that 's a little to radically changed .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about regional food . we eat organic .
and if you say , that the things are the future of good food that 's somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey , people , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
i be honest ?
i like this question .
no , not , because we 've been enough calories are producing the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are today <unk> .
a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because <unk> inequalities that in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not , because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about the hell .
grows , corn , <unk> , <unk> , you know monocultures , chemicals , the earth , grilled chicken , fish , and all the time has the agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we 're more people 's cheaper to how awful can it be ? ''
that was the motivation . it was the which . it was the plan , the american agriculture .
we should they call , is , if you in <unk> , if you really , that fast , who end of its cover the right now this production to .
that 's not if you really , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> today is threatened , because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through the fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not by a chainsaw , but through the forests , and not by were doing and nets , but by the fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
they let us to start with the question : how we going to feed itself ?
or better , how we can help conditions do , every community to enable , to feed ?
to bring that do , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at <unk> and it has never something really good for food produced .
we look instead , the environmental role model .
so that is , that on two billion years <unk> <unk> .
you look , miguel , farmers how miguel ,
businesses , not worlds for instance , are , businesses , personally , rather <unk> , businesses , the <unk> grow , rather than just hard to farmers , not just gases are , but experts , relationships ,
because they are the ones who also hired experts , flavor .
and when i really be honest , i 'm sure you 're a better , chef : when i do it ever be .
so you know that 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , it will delicious .
thank you .
i get if you today a thing that they want it 's the totality of the data , we consume , 's bigger than the sum of bits and instead of it , <unk> to think i want to you think about how we information that can use , that , patterns have the and we so at the foods , otherwise , not visible to become friends would .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> after the old way .
the program , here that i use , is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do is , after a certain death filter it can , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns , that , .
and it , because in <unk> here in the people at <unk> are and they over here at <unk> .
we can a step on out and make the data , then , and see , <unk> and cancer in the usual suspects , are , but not for everyone .
if we now go and after the age of the number , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see , accidents , even the cause is about the , the people care to be .
and who <unk> see , this is especially in men 's true .
you see , that look of information and data in this way , very , swim in a living <unk> reminds us .
and if we do this for raw data can make , why not , the content in itself ?
what we now have here are the front covers , every single , `` the sport <unk> '' , ever actually been .
it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
you can it would like to my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can be able to pull in a decade .
you can just are in a year .
you can go directly to a copy one .
now if i look over here , i see the athletes , in this 've reached out and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong 's a fan , so i click , here 's driving , all tell me to show , where you have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> so people get to , i could think , `` ok , what if i all with the subject of walking , i look ? ''
so i a step back and <unk> the way .
now i 'll be greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of them , if you this information on , specifically , , much more <unk> , <unk> , for you ca n't or <unk> not just .
you do something , that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way , and the way , how information can be .
i want this idea now a little out on with about what a little crazy .
what we here have done is , we have any of <unk> taken and they 're on a little summary .
the summary of a short , often , and a symbol for the area of that they come .
i 'm just , the top of 500 of the popular <unk> .
but even in this as a view , we can a lot of things do .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues , on wikipedia , the popular .
i 'm now the issue <unk> `` vote .
now , after i <unk> , who have you know what i feel that the <unk> , the most so , `` time magazine , `` people the year . '' .
this is really important , there is a realization that is , not in a single <unk> that .
that 's just to see if you a step back and the entire at .
overlooking the of this <unk> i can then in the theme of time magazine , `` people the year . '' in to go , and all together .
now if i say these people as you know what i feel that the majority of <unk> . some people come from the science . some , less , come from the economy . here 's my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now one and a view on all the ted prize winner 's look .
you see , we 're surfing the web the first time as if it also really a net is , not only one of the side to , but much more abstractly .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise to be .
i 'll show you here 's just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i want it 's not a browser call it ; it 's really not a browser , but you can do web to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single one website , like this .
so i can a step back , and directly to a specific <unk> jump .
that 's why most important , because you just by that look at the web in this kind of the way , all the <unk> the same way , and the way you can .
so i can in my during zoom in a certain time .
here is the entire demonstration , i 'm going to go this thought .
and i can sort everything , what i now been considered to have , back .
and if i went back a step <unk> and on all look , i mean by the course , this may after my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' `` for , here , bing , right here to live labs <unk> .
and from here , in the side in it and they went back up .
it 's a metaphor , and used , and every time , it makes the overall picture than the sum of pieces .
the moment in the world , we think , that data a curse .
we talk of the cursing the <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation around you could and the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead , a couple of the other to go to start of many things to many things go to tell , and it creates pattern of see , what otherwise , hidden behind them would be ?
if we do this can push , this record <unk> , maybe a new source of sense of information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we know it .
and if we know that experience , then we can maybe even the wisdom of it .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went with the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my thoughts in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> in my deep in me sitting , this voracious , curiosity satisfied .
this curiosity that , too , that i always , when i 'm not in the school was , by the forests <unk> , walked and `` 25,000 samples . '' which collected , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , all home to be brought and under the microscope at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was so , the trial , the world to understand and the limits of explore .
and my love to science fiction , to , in my environment picture , because the time , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and they were exploring the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing tv , animals and places and a world of wonder showed that we do before i never have can imagine .
that has then , very good to the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither of video , this <unk> with computer-generated movies , the imagery in the media , i had to the images in my head .
that we had at all . if we as children 's a book read , we entered the description of the author and projected that they look at the screen in our minds .
my response to it was the drawing and painting of alien , alien worlds , robots , the spacecrafts , and all so what .
in class , i was time from teachers get one , i , below the hidden , <unk> .
the creativity to , somehow figure out .
and it was something interesting . what makes me , which , jacques <unk> they were intrigued , was the idea . we can be completely unknown , the world here on our earth itself .
certainly would i mean , never an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed to me pretty unlikely .
but here was a world , i actually enter it could , here on the earth , and she was just amazing , and more exotic as all that , what i always had imagined , when i these books had read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , scuba divers that .
the only problem of it was , in a small village in canada , living , one , miles from the ocean away .
of and i but not <unk> .
i 've been bugging my father , until he finally , <unk> in the shittiest climate , new york , participants had made , the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in winter , in the shittiest climate , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , i received only two years later to face , as we need to california , it .
since , in the 40 years , now <unk> are , i spent about three , hours , under water spent . 500 million hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world , the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich , <unk> life is , how we do it gives us really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature does n't know the borders , unlike in to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to today days i feel that i just utter awe , that , what i on my early dives , i see .
and my love to the ocean , holding , with the same intensity as they said , and ever .
when i then as adults , a job <unk> , it was that <unk> .
that seemed the best way , my inner drive the stories to share with my need to take pictures to create , to unite .
as a kid was doing , i always in comic books and so .
so , movies , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
of course , the stories , i <unk> , from the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
, `` <unk> '' i was my penchant for the <unk> and that come with the <unk> connect .
so intertwined , of my two passions .
you see something happened , `` <unk> '' : to a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that we had so a kind of liquid <unk> create -- , <unk> we 're on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what about that came out , was the computer-generated <unk> , ever in a film to see .
the film . and it 's no money , right told them was he just over time , by a , but i realized something fascinating , the audience around the world was like it was mesmerized by the magic , of it was initiated .
according to arthur clarke 's law . you know <unk> technology and magic does n't know , each other to tell them .
they saw so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , that has to do in the cinematic be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , '' , my next movie , much more .
together with <unk> created , there , the guy of liquid metal . the success were very of imagination . , like this effect come to easily .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have with the movie , a little bit more money <unk> .
of these experiences from , was a very new world , a very new world of creativity , <unk> .
so i started a company , along with my good friend with stan winston studio , the to the time the best <unk> and <unk> . they called `` well , <unk> . ''
the idea of the company , it was the phase , analogous processes with the visual <unk> etc . to skip the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we did , and -- that a while a competitive advantage .
but the '90s , i realized we , we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` computational avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects , new heights , it should , realistic human , expressive characters , using <unk> it 's been were . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put stuff , and the people in my company told me , we <unk> still not in the able to be saying that create .
so then shifted , and made these other film about the big ship , that goes .
the <unk> i think that as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> distilled <unk> , a film .
secretly , but i wanted to actually , real ants cover up the titanic to immerse ourselves .
i put it the movie .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that , but not .
i mean , but i 'm convinced , by i said , `` we come to the cover up . we films that real up .
we will it in the <unk> the movie .
that 's incredibly important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , a major expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to the own imagination a reality we can actually create .
we then created in fact , six months later a reality , in the i 'm in russian <unk> found himself , four miles of the surface of the north , and i think about the real titanic , through a <unk> understanding .
that was no movie , not definition , that was really .
so , that has really amazes me away .
and the preparation that were enormous . we had cameras and of the light and everything possible building .
and i fell on the very this <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up in this capsule , it you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope , saving is , it does n't even back to do .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's as well , as if i 'm in <unk> .
that 's really cool . ''
i was really obsessed with the study the deep .
anyway , of the part , with curiosity and science has to do . it was it . it was an adventure , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience , made me to do n't give you could .
because , you know , i was able to me a creature , imagine , for that we then a visual on the place could . but i could n't tell me that 's imagine , what i was outside the window would see .
in on the following expeditions i beings in <unk> seen , and sometimes the things i still never seen before had , sometimes , the things at all , nobody ever seen before , and for the science , at , as we do you saw , still ca n't have words , he had found .
that , i was so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i then a something unusual .
after the success of `` titanic '' i tell me , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood goes on ice on top and i 'm going for a while <unk> . ''
and we then , we came up to `` <unk> '' , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we returned to cover up the titanic transition back .
we took a little robot , we built had a , a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and , the inside the ship at , never before i 've been developed .
nobody had ever the inside <unk> demands . you had still not for another . so we have developed the necessary to technology .
well , and there sitting i mean , the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , this <unk> here 's quite similar , and of whom i know , once the band , there .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the gears on the ship .
i so if it 's just really , but my mind is within the <unk> .
it felt , as if i exercise within the <unk> the titanic , and there .
that was the <unk> of <unk> , i ever experienced . because before i each to a corner <unk> , i 've always been called the same in <unk> the <unk> that would , i conducted months about <unk> did was , as we the film has been around .
that set it was , which is an exact replica of the plans , the ship .
so that was an extremely strange .
they made me this <unk> to be aware that you have such <unk> avatars are using and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different shape of existence embarrassed .
it was really an incredibly profound
and may also a brief act on that , maybe in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> has to something to explore motion or other things to do , in all kinds <unk> <unk> , i told me as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions we began that , what we get down there had seen , really appreciate to learn , for this <unk> , where we these incredible shares the animals , . that are sort of the aliens , but here on earth .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .
they are not in the sunlight , but the system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the right next one of 500 degrees to say that they survive there .
the same time was i also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended up at the people , for the space that interest and with the nasa to have and in <unk> sit and right <unk> plan . they go to russia , through , the mission that <unk> protocol <unk> all the drum and it , fly , then the international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
that was amazing .
but the end , it was going to come out , <unk> with us in the deep took .
i took you , and <unk> you access to the world upside down there , <unk> , <unk> , people , for these areas of situations in . i took you to the sources , so , you look around , take them from and instruments , we could and so forth .
we turned out that in documentary , run , but actually science , specifically , <unk> .
so effectively lock , the circle anywhere between my existence as <unk> , then , as a child , and the and to do in the reality .
in the course of these landscapes as i have a lot of learned .
i have a lot about science that . but now i think they certainly , a director refer to also can lead , a leader be like a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i do this research expeditions <unk> .
because , a certain point i had to tell me , `` what i actually here ?
why i doing that ? what comes out of it ? ''
these stinking movies migrate to us no money .
we play time now , by a . of fame , not a lane .
all think , i was between , `` titanic '' and `` computational avatar . '' <unk> and have to me , the nails it on a towel that the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , in documentary , for a very audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what you doing just ?
if you do it to the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , there 's . you do it the <unk> because , and because of funny connection , the amount of the same is a small group of people a team is .
because we all this with only 10 to 12 people did , many years , it has worked . sometimes we were to two , three months row on the lake .
and in this community you realize that the most important thing the warning — is , you , each other , because you a task that has , you any other .
if you , land back and , says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and the very precise idea , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you on the lake has been working , '' then you do that other just ca n't explain . that 's the police or at the ground , something together we have gone through and you know , it never struck anyone can explain .
there is a connection , each other respect .
when i so back to my next film `` computational avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the <unk> to , which is that you could be a respected and , in return of respect , deserves .
it was the dynamics really changed .
there i was so again with a small team on the unknown terrain . we were about `` computational avatar . '' with a new technology , it before , not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years , right family .
it changed , my way , films to do , completely .
it was giving people , said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and the planet pandora transport .
for me it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , the , in the result has changed .
what we can so from all of close ?
the lessons we learned ?
i think , at the first , is the curiosity .
it 's the most human feature of .
our imagination is a force , even a reality we can actually create .
and the aware of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , say , they give me a benign advice , like that can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that get yourself , others for you . do it does n't you yourself , she 'll not against . but to take risks on you . ''
the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail as an alternative to be , because there , guarantees that 's a leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation for at , was ever done without risk being addressed .
you must be ready , these risks on , to take .
that 's the idea , i like to deal with the way to give you want . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and that i 've just maybe something that , because my <unk> at the foundation of the vaccines , and i 'd be about the things , we make up , and they have to the poorest two billion a better life to sustain .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , just took even more than for every other on the planet .
<unk> mean , whose <unk> about how many years , not to grow . it we need to a lot sooner or to a rain . the things will , so we change , how it their fragile environment is not withstand that can .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate change , terrible for you 're going .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
the fact , is that , if you just from one thing the price down could , to <unk> would energy in near the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , you .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> towards the industrial revolution , and even in 20 . century , there 's a <unk> case in <unk> and so we have the refrigerators , painless climate , we can modern materials to make and so many things do .
we are so in a wonderful , electricity in the rich world .
but if we the price down -- we let us the price in case -- we meet on a new barrier , and this barrier on with carbon .
co2 fed up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , this is a result , the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not to the way , and so a whole systems to come together .
now , the exact number of connection between a <unk> and of the net <unk> and where their more important consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there 's safe <unk> about how to bad , these operabots follow . but they are extremely well-connected ; it be .
i have the <unk> times , and asked , `` we really down on the near zero to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero to come , the temperature on up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a 3.5 feet high office truck , under a $ 3 feet a bridge from . the then you can basically , from them down .
this must , after the bottom , zero .
now , we into every year , a lot <unk> from the 26 billion pounds .
every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than a .
the average are 's about five million tons for every item on the planet .
and somehow we need to change that it on a zero cost down .
it 's been consistently as up .
just different economic changes to have it , and we need to of <unk> in order to a reduction , and to a reduction , until the zero .
this equation , four factors . a basic multiplication problem . they have this thing left -- and co2 -- , that they 're moving towards zero to break , and that will of the number of people depend on , of the service , every person in the average use the average of energy for every service and the co2 , that per unit of energy <unk> will .
they let us so every single factor of them look , and i think we , how we that the zero .
probably needs to a sort of these numbers very close , zero to come .
now that 's the basic algebra , but we go about it 's time through .
first , we the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people .
and it is advancing on 9 billion to . the , nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that , to 10 percent to 15 percent down , but at the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second piece of these are the services , we use .
that involves all the food , we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services , almost any of the planet accessible to .
it 's great , this number drops .
in the rich world , in the upper half billion , we could probably <unk> do and less use , but the average will this number of every year go up and , so , in more than double , the number of services , per person to be provided by .
here we see a very basic health service . there 's going to home light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so they go out and reading your schoolwork whatsoever worked under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally got news .
we have something , that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , by other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , their energy needed some of those services , let me , 90 percent to happen .
in other vital service , like the making of <unk> , is 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> the scope for improvement is very much smaller .
in general , if we make these are , maybe a need to a factor , three or maybe even to a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that 's just not from .
we see us so the fourth factor , -- and this is a profound transitions to be -- this is the amount of co2 , per unit of energy <unk> will .
it turns , the question , if you that the zero can get .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> now , the co2 , the renewables , and my rocketry that .
so , what we 're on a global level to come up , is , a new system to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , '' i use , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor inside is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of the hand .
normally , there 's not a deadline , you a miracle to a date , needs .
usually is you basically just wrong and some people come to do n't .
in this case , we but you floor , and give a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how to really <unk> ?
there 's a natural place , a demonstration , the idea of people here heat ?
i think back , last year , when i mosquitos . and kind of the people that .
the idea was for you really accessible , you know that , people there , with these life .
for energy , i noticed that here .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies , my <unk> contribution to the environment would be here .
so here are a natural or fireflies .
you has told me , they do n't bite . in fact , they will probably wo n't time that glass of art .
now , there 's all kinds <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need technological solutions , either , or of the an incredible this scale and how incredible dependability . and although it many different directions , there , where people committed to go , i really just five , these big needs can afford .
i have the tides , <unk> the merger and better biofuels out .
this afford to maybe a ; on the contribution , and if you better to afford , when i expect to be the great , but i mean that 's here is , we , all those five to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because they us imagine , because all have significant problems .
we look at first of the burning fossil fuels , burning of either of coal or gas .
what you there to alert , it may simply , but that 's not . you have to all the co2 , that after the burning of the and comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then , somewhere between them , and hope that , there 's left .
there 's some well , that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent to create , but it on 100 percent to get is very difficult to be . and a way for the storage during the co2 to make , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who would have to make sure ?
who can do something you , literally , many billions of time than any kind of waste , you , of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
that 's a lot of volume .
so that 's a hard <unk> .
the next thing : my rocketry that .
the also has three big problems . the cost , all , in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , you really feel to do n't go wrong can , despite the human organization , the fuel not for weapons are used .
and what makes you then with the waste handled ?
because even though he 's not very large is , there 's a lot about .
so three very difficult problems , maybe even though they are , and , where you that work should .
the last three of five , i 've summarized .
it are some renewables , often be called .
and also the have -- although it is great , you to do n't make fuel you need -- they have some downsides .
one thing , is the <unk> , these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you talk about of you <unk> , times more land area as a normal power .
also see these various sources <unk> .
the sun does n't seem to the whole day , it also not every day and as blows , the wind and not the time .
so you have to , of these various sources that 's dependent on , a way to have the energy , in times when they do is available , to get .
there 's so here , <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . if we example , say that the power of the country is , you do n't just the technology , they have to also with the risk around the solar energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the dimension to show , i 've all kinds of the batteries , be made , at , for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of the electronic energy , which the world that uses , compared . i found out to all the batteries , we now producing , less than 10 minutes of maintains them , you could .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something , to a factor of 100 vastly better be going to the approaches to the time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy .
that happens , if you 're trying to this <unk> sources , we say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of uses to .
if you , 100 percent to survive to , they need a incredible -- no .
now , where we going to go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies , it work . hundreds .
in every one of five different areas we need at least 100 people .
, you 're going to say , are nuts . that 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's many , there , engaged .
bill that has multiple different companies , under things , called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies in the great things do and interesting ways , and i look at the place .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company , the , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in <unk> , repetitive , liquid .
the development has in this industry , some time i stopped , so it 's no big surprise , some good ideas lying .
that <unk> mean , you instead of a part of <unk> , a percent , that <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent to burn , that <unk> .
that 's quite a crazy idea .
but actually had you about , long time thinking , but you could never been properly and simulating outcome , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputer that there , you simulate and see , : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like , that , <unk> .
and because you , 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , you the garbage , and you can even the waste of today for them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , you simply burn it . a great thing .
the low-enriched uranium dioxide is too uses , a little bit like a candle that .
you see , it sort of a bar is , often as `` traveling the wave of reactor . '' called .
that solve really that <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent . you has the part , now gets going to <unk> so it mean <unk> uranium .
that <unk> the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you have fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts , we need to move forward to come .
think we , how we our success to measure to .
how to our own testimony to look ?
now , we go to the goal , that we have to and then we can talk about the <unk> .
a lot about a lot of giving 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's really important , that we go into .
the rest of 20 percent are in poor countries , will , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement to clean be .
so , to these 80 percent to , to the developed world , including many countries like china , their <unk> completely to change .
the other note she says , whether we the <unk> technology could use , if you in all the developed countries used is , and we the way are , you to the rest to get .
that 's great deal .
that is a shift : this <unk> .
if we from there back , how to the 2020 as testament to look ?
it should be back the two elements of them .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the way to . ever , we <unk> , more than going to the <unk> , and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we company , not completely to the big <unk> , just the same , or even something less important as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for this amazing breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs , we do with the floor to track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this issue .
that al gore book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the skeptical about the air . ''
they go it really , and create a frame , this broad range of can be , because we need for support of all sides .
there 's a few things , that come together .
that 's a wish .
a very specific wish , we do this technology making up .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years to allow , i could the president to choose which , lasts , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , which is , <unk> <unk> without losing co2 is being invented . this desire to take , i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we have this desire does n't get , the redwood will dig in between the long and the short business people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion people to be very much worse .
what to we do ?
for which things <unk> i ?
we need to for more the context of use .
if countries , in places like <unk> meet , they should not only about carbon .
you should all these <unk> talk , and they were shocked by the ridiculous , very little money , this highly innovative approaches to spend .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> <unk> trade something , <unk> do .
we need to spread the message .
we need a dialogue sphere and the entire lead and also the things , of the government to be done .
it is a desire , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . only to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you get us a notion of scale of investment to be ?
bill gates : the simulation on a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have to ensure that , could work , is you only in the <unk> million .
the tough to step is that build the first toolkit , another billion to find the <unk> and the place the fact , of building .
once the first 's done , when he that 's like i promised , everything is very clear , because the sense , the <unk> is so , rocketry , how we do you know .
the right to understand : that deep in the ground to almost like a vertical pillar of nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then it starts the process , up and works , and after the bottom ?
bg : exactly . now you have to the reactor , new stuff , so there 's many people and lots of control is the wrong . this thing where you know it opens and stuff <unk> or out . that 's not good !
but when you very cheap fuel , you can tell him for 60 years into it -- you think , a bar on -- the you 've been buried , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and takes for 60 years , and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the garbage and again .
bg : yeah . well , with the garbage is happening : you can see him sitting , let 's -- there 's much less of with this method -- then they take him and grab him in the reactor and burn it on .
and we start by the way we the garbage can take the already exists , in this <unk> or <unk> the reactors is . that 's our <unk> .
so this is that , for these reactors operate a problem was , that , what we in our fill and so that is that <unk> dramatically reduce the process .
but while you with different people , this world about these are talking to have ,
where it 's the interest , so what really easy to ?
bg : well , we still not on a place their and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there are big interest and the people the company that were in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the minister , and talked about , like this to <unk> .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a variation in one thing , was done .
that she is a step forward , but it 's like a faster reactor and some countries have this built , why is everybody , a rapid reactor was implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in your idea : the time frame and odds , really into life to call ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> the things 're very affordable , we have 20 years , for reinventing and then 20 years to use .
that 's sort of the deadline , the <unk> actually has , we are all .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything well it , and that 's a desire to be that easy .
and fortunately , there 's now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of the , as well , when their new approaches to work , for for your drone pilots to work , for <unk> can .
and it would be the question , if it 's a couple of creating , since then you could be a mixture use .
, we need a solution .
it had the kinds breakthroughs , this is the , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> that is announcing .
that it would also , without the <unk> been , but the power 's still so much more .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another very innovative companies .
you know , we know whose work not so well , like this , but there 's the up the way , that 's a other approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard to , but you might say , that about us .
and so there 's different , but the nice about this is , <unk> a million , much energy has a bit like , we say , a <unk> and so , if you with the problems can get around and the are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential so the impact on the country and other things , almost ran in your league schools .
if that does n't , what ?
we need to <unk> come to try to the <unk> stable enough to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation is coming , it 's as if you to a lot has eaten , and a moment ago , a heart attack them . what makes you then ? you might be a <unk> or anything .
there 's a <unk> the , <unk> called , with various techniques can go into the warming continues to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer had to us <unk> .
that 's just a <unk> .
you 're looking for , that we do n't need .
some people say , you should not only , the insurance to work , because a that might be lazy , so you and eats , because you know , a the <unk> save .
i do n't know , if that 's smart , is , if you , the importance of this problem , eyes are that , but there 's now a larger discourse in <unk> , if you that to have to , if the things faster come , this innovation , no longer need , as we expect .
climate change , you have a or two large sentences for the cell to you might want to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones who , the case to do , are very little bit .
they say that , negative effects , there , with the clouds to have the things here ?
there 's very , few things , you even say , of it 's a chance in a million there .
that <unk> here 's so much like , aids .
you what makes the mistake now , and you pay for very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds compiled all problems , in something to invest in that you only later , what has -- and to come to the investment is not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario , and there 's people in the rich world , climate at and say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact is , this uncertainty of us to worry that .
but my dream is here , that , it , economic can do , and at the co2 was eliminated , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it 's interested me not , that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost , it did that , but i 'm it probably never accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer on the <unk> lomborg comes , that , if you all this time and energy use to the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals , suffer the <unk> , the proper of malaria and so , that 's a stupid waste of resources that 's the money for to invest , as it better , there , we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , you spend when they do today -- that 's not so dramatically .
it should be other things not suffer .
you come then to big <unk> , and here we are moments people disagree with , if you something , that 's not economic growth is , and tried , that to finance . for me happening here is the most of waste .
it was because , you is very short , a <unk> and funded the only still the curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich up .
i mean , each of us here , five , much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even lomborg comes to think .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research , not more about ? ''
he will still , because of its former stories , <unk> associated , but he has got to suggest that a very rare group is , and that brings he now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> , the , i need to think .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little , by 2027 .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope to her wish , right . you , thank you .
bg : thanks .
few years ago , here at ted , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> to the biggest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> ourselves and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow to on top .
and , though it really just seems , it 's actually really hard , because it people being very quickly work together .
and so i thought , that this is a really interesting idea is that i and it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops world 's done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something , this task , deep , some insights in the nature of collaboration and understand and i want some of them to share with you .
usually to the most people , in the task to orient .
you talk about , you go to look like it will look , they squeak , to go ,
then we invest , a little time in planning and organization . they began drawing and put <unk> .
they invest a lot of their time in the to build the time <unk> scale .
and finally , just before they have no time , you have to take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently into the top , to a step back and `` <unk> '' ! again , your work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that the `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the weight of the marshmallow and the whole thing , space and <unk> .
there 's a number of people , much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have more than others , and the worst are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course there 's also management teams , much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and the best are totally fresh alumni of kindergarten .
and that 's pretty amazing .
like us , peter ward was to make you 're not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask , is : we do that ? why ? what about where ?
and peter 's telling : `` none of children in time it 's head of <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's still a whole other reason .
and it , that mba , were , a real plan to find , ok !
and it , then to realize .
now what happens when you the marshmallow the top of profanity , they have no time more and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently , is that you with the marshmallow start and prototypes to build , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , the top , so that you is the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
certainly constructionists recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> about .
and with every attempt to get the kids right across the feedback , what works and what do n't .
so this is the performance , prototypes to work , much -- but we see once , how different teams to operate .
the average for the most is at about . <unk> the mba students to the half of the lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately , .
<unk> is the , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles , and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
ceos are something about the average . but here is it 's interesting .
it 's a coral that will administrator at the team , they would be better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , and see , `` this team is going to win . ''
you can the predictions . why does it ?
because they particular skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and that , that <unk> and the work to pay attention is the performance of teams -- would improve .
propagated across the skills and <unk> and the combination of lead to success .
if you 10 teams have the unique to be going to get you ca . six , stable and we have .
i did well , very exciting .
i thought , and we the <unk> .
so she offered i a $ 10,000 dollars a price , software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if someone 's a <unk> of construction , built have , he have the price to home by .
so it 's not interesting , high <unk> a strong have the effect ?
we reenacted this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood you the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , for team of the best .
they produced the construction in the least of time .
there 's so <unk> lessons for us the nature of incentive and success .
you might ask : why would someone in fact , invest a <unk> to go ahead ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to make them to multidisciplinary teams to help , cars , video and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> does is , they help them hidden collection of them to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or obstruction . <unk> , the right prototype to build .
and this is the value of experience , this is so easy to practice .
and those of them , it 's interested , <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see , the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all the world , how people that system to and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is the structure actually a <unk> sports .
it in order , we all our senses , the task to and , we our thinking that can use , like our feelings and our do , in the challenge , on us .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience all , what it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to .
and that can a big difference .
thank you .
we do so as if we have here 's a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a machine .
and everybody in this room to skeletal muscle .
and you can in the past , you can in the future to go ; they can not in here and now , to ,
and i ask me , what you would , because i my friends in the last time , often asked this question of have , and they all in the past go .
i do n't know . they wanted to the time , before it cars , or twitter or `` america for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced , you kind of the sort of nostalgia , to wishful thinking , with this is .
and that i do .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i will not in the past , and that 's not , because i 'm a principal explorers i 'm --
it 's like , that are on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
so i want in this machine , and i want to the future .
this is the greatest time , it ever attempted on this planet , no matter , which the scale , they make : health , wealth , and mobility , but the declining <unk> .
it was never been a time , like this .
my <unk> died , when they were 60 were .
my grandparents had urged this number on 70 .
my parents are the one of the into iraq .
there should so much better a nine the beginning of my <unk> .
but it 's not time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , that today in delhi , born , can expect , so long to live like the richest man on the 100 years ago .
you think about . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox would have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of earth on a way to be shaped , how it 's no war , ever done .
they 're way . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . go pfft .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , threatened to have to do n't still .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
i know all , somebody , what is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , that are some successes the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method , to test things , look , if it works , it change , if it does n't that does , the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately is , the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often ,
and one of this is , despite all of our greatest achievements of a billion people in the world every day when to go .
this number drops , and they 're going up very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and that , we have our imagination used to , this world that we had to your choice .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and that soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> , we also .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think is .
i think it 's clear , we food can produce the billion people feed , without the country , the they live , to rape her .
i think , we can this world with energy to power , they 're not the same destroyed .
i think that really , and no , that 's not wishful thinking .
but that here 's holding me up every night -- one of the things me up every night . we have the science progress , never been so i need to like now , never ,
and we were also still never in the opportunity to him about <unk> , we do it today .
we are , the threshold to an amazing , astonishing design events on the many areas . and yet , i really , we are hundreds , 300 years ago , the enlightenment , back to have to a time to find in the we progress , so there have , in the we 're talking about these things <unk> <unk> have , more in front lines , now .
the people putting , in their , and it 's so closely , you do n't free .
not time the truth will they free .
and you , everybody has a right on their opinion , ; even a right on their opinion , for progress ,
but you know , what they were not quite have ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while it took the three out .
ago about a decade , i have a paper , vaccination , `` the new yorker , '' written , a small paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to run into the resistance , the , at the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always do , i wrote a paper , on .
and soon after that i wrote a paper about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were getting crazy .
so i also about an article written , and i could n't understand why the people thought , that would `` <unk> '' , why they thought , molecules on a certain kind of a random jumble of move a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do so what i do . i wrote the articles , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we type , we 're rich , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles were made me , and i could n't figure out , why , and finally , i found it turns out .
and that it 's because , this <unk> , made me nuts were actually do n't <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly how the people in this room .
and that got me that mess that ...
but then i thought , you know what to be we 're honest ,
we 're in one point where , the we 're not just the same relationship to the progress , how much earlier .
we talk <unk> .
we talk to be ironic of them , with a little quotes about , `` no progress . ''
okay , for it 's the reasons , and i think we know , which one that are .
we have the faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and there 's no reason , why that 's not so to be .
you can just a name call , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , of mass , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list your vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , where we thought , always right to have . be so they are skeptical .
imagine if you ask , for you have evidence , for you some evidence .
they take nothing more than any given .
but now comes it , if you evidence to get you have to this evidence to assume , and , we are not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say , we now in an epidemic of fear for life , i they still never seen have and hopefully will never see again .
ago about 12 years was a story published , a terrible story , <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in the connection .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see , if that 's true .
lots of studies we should be done , that 's a serious .
the data came in .
the data came in , from the key from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no significant correlation , no link , not .
it makes no difference . it makes no difference , because we , anecdotes , we think , what we see , what we need to see , what does , we really feel .
we do n't think , a bunch of documents from a <unk> , of us data , there , and i do that , i think the do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was a catastrophic ,
catastrophic , because of the fact , the u.s. is one of one individual countries in the world , the immunization , <unk> down .
that 's absolutely scandalous outrage , and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened , that we could do .
now , i understand that . that i 'm doing .
because , here somebody <unk> ?
okay , one in the audience ever hear somebody , <unk> die see ?
it 's not very often .
what happens in this country do n't , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths made by <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we go out , and people like jenny mccarthy , we can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like the oprah and larry king live as .
and that you can do , because they cause and the correlation was not connecting .
they do n't understand , these things i 'll seem to be , but virtually never the same thing .
and that 's something , that we learn to , and it 's very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
he was liberated us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , not a very matter-of-factly , polio , go pfft , gone .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he called `` paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> .
he can the life of <unk> , a million children per year in the developing to save .
pretty well , not ?
so , that 's good , besides some of , paul around and over the vaccines , talks , and says , how valuable they are , and that the people just stop should be able to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul cézanne so this is a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , he can not without being armed foot on one of behavior .
he gets calls home , because the people he 'd like to tell you know where his children to school .
and why ? because paul a vaccine against has done .
i do n't say that , but the vaccines are essential .
you take you on , let 's the disease , terrible disease , and that is happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and that is worse , and pretty soon be kids back to die , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they will not just , <unk> die .
what about polio this ? we take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me , i 'm going on a few weeks , and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever said before .
they would , not against polio immunized . on no one case .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't see polio this . and you know what ?
we had in this country , no polio virus .
now , i do n't know , maybe she now this morning , someone in lagos , a plane and the right now to go to los angeles , the moment he is about ohio .
and in a few hours , goes , he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he is one of <unk> <unk> today at night and visit .
and he did n't know , he with a stock disease by this is , and we know that 's also not , because it works , the world .
this is the planet , the we live . they do n't so , as if he did n't that 's .
we love it , us in a lie to mutate . we love that .
they have today morning , all their supply vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the can do to .
i know , that they have made , because half the americans , that every day .
you take that stuff , and they take an alternative to cure , and it makes no difference , how often we find out , they 're useless .
the data up the time .
they darkening them their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to over 10 billion dollars for the urine .
i voice you completely .
it urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
now , i think , i understand -- we hate the industry .
we hate a to strong government . we have n't trust the solar system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us , it can afford .
we walk , so before , and where we walk , we ?
we walk in the poor the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's really a serious , because that stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for me .
and i 've all kinds of little it and here .
none of -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , <unk> , i 'm not time , what that is , but we give a billion dollars for , it 's cheating .
and you know what ? if i think that would say , shouting at me the people , and say , `` what does it you ? let the people , but do , what they want .
so you feel . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it i don’t care is , it the minister is , says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to mammography does n't assume , '' or any <unk> , his patients with <unk> treat the idea .
if you on this way out , where i think , and magic of evidence and science to replace , get to use , a place , the they do n't want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki 's in south africa .
he got about 400,000 its people , because he was that was the red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , where we know , the course of aids , the brake light .
hundreds undue death in a country , the worse than each other kinds of this disease <unk> will .
you tell me , please do n't , these things do n't have consequences .
the have you . the you have always .
now the <unk> epidemic , in the we just are , is this to fight between the <unk> <unk> there , food and the <unk> .
that 's a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , this metaphor .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody brussels sprouts , of the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in the garden .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas . we all this .
we have it in the last thousand years .
and some of this has n't work and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid of america , not work .
now we look . and of course there 's risk . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , do , and that stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to prolong life .
that you want to do n't do ?
i must say , that i do n't .
we refuse <unk> changed the food .
why we do that ?
now , what i always hear is : to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want a huge areas with one thing , that 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies to live and patent .
we do n't want to companies seeds .
and so you know what my answer on this is ?
yeah , right . fix that we can .
it 's true , we have a <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has with science is nothing to do .
it 's right , moral , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company is .
you is no country .
you is n't an idea ; they is a way .
you is a way , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but the idea , we of science , not allow us to , your work to do , because we 're afraid to have is a really dead , and they 're holding millions of people from humans flourish .
you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to 70 percent more than growing food to as the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we give it does n't tell you .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people do n't be empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , , for example <unk> .
<unk> is something , that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's miserable .
it has n't require nutrients , it has no one protein , and scientists building that all right now at a .
and then we could the people that food and would n't think there are going .
they would n't starvation , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i 'm trying to say , is : why fight , that ?
i mean , we ask : why fight , that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about the genes move . it 's not going to throw chemicals .
it 's not to our ridiculous passion for our hormones , our it be on the greater , better food , act of food .
it 's not to the rice <unk> , it 's about , the life to get , and it is highest , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't that do , if we so on to how far do we , something guilty , the we , i think , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to that really stop .
after this incredible kind of entertainment , you want so we might say , you still in this ridiculous machine , and the future go ? ''
, . that i want , .
the moment is you in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can this machine on all imagine , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we they 're moving to , and we 're going to go to move , where we want .
we need to these conversations , and we need to think , but if we in the machine , up and the future , we will be happy to be that we 've done .
i know , we do it , and as it me in terms , that 's what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i 've come for the <unk> . it may seem curious , that , a magician interested in that , it was because , you look at it 's so how i , as `` a deception , to something real , if someone just , enough that thinks . ''
with other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , and it 's just so , because the person thinks , with her happening , was a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there 's , if the patient , we 're , enough that thinks , a measurable effect of the body , you the <unk> .
a deception is going to something real , because somebody 's so the world .
so that we 're also understanding , i want you now a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i 'm going to show you know , he works . that 's a trick , the least for the 1950s , in any <unk> for children .
i even have taught him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s that .
i 'm going to him for you do and it , then you explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i do it , let me .
so , you see what happens .
that knife , that they 're looking at can ; my hand , they study .
i 'm that knife just so in my off .
i pleading my sleeve .
and to make sure , nothing in my sleeve away , or from him out , i 'm just my wrist , right here <unk> .
on this way they can see , it any time something to move . as i 'm here <unk> , nothing in my sleeve , as it or out .
and the goal of it 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if all good about , is that knife by my bare physical , magnetics ago .
it 's actually so , there , his place , it might shake it can , without that knife falls off .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and you can all work .
<unk> !
so , that 's a trick , i often a little kids affect , for magic that interest , because you can , very much about deception to learn to actually more specifically looking , though it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room this trick .
he does this :
i think that knife in my hand .
i say , my wrist <unk> , to make sure , nothing in my sleeve away , or out , and that 's a lie .
the reason , why i my wrist <unk> the , at the real secret of illusion is .
in the moment , which , where i mean by hand of you <unk> , so you back of see , moves , of fingers over here , my <unk> , just from there , where he was , in a position , in the he was so extended .
it 's trick ?
back there 's got someone , not a childhood had .
so , he , this is here . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the finger at its position .
and now you could talk about , why that 's a deception is , why you ca n't seeing , down here 's just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way , he 's information of course , they 're not one by counting , one , two , three , but you as a group .
but it 's now here 's not actually , and then i open , i mean by hand .
course it will be there would have no , but not by the fact , magnetics my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , now there is .
and when i mean by hand , let me , it 's the same thing , by i <unk> , going through this movement of the finger , again <unk> .
i guess these hand away . and here is that knife .
this trick , your friends and i used to demonstrate . thanks .
now , the with the <unk> to do ?
year ago , or so , i read a study , i 'm really right away .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in the form a white pill to step , in the form of <unk> , is that just a round , white pill , that a measurable effect .
but if you the shape , in the you that <unk> give them , for instance , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue color and a letter , cloaking them , it is actually measurably so much .
and that , though , no one of any pharmaceutical industry ... it are just <unk> .
but a white ball is not so well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really crazy .
it turned , but out , that still not everything is .
if you capsules that takes , are the more effective than pills and every form .
a colored the capsule , in one end of yellow and the red is , is better than a white capsule .
also the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not so well as three pills -- i can i 'm going to do n't , the statistics , remember . do i 'm sorry .
the really , but is , ...
... that 's also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape to play .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle grasp .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , you a patient gets into .
that creates a very powerful image in the head . that 's very much more than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you a different time to know if we have a <unk> .
the fact , so this is that the white pill , not so well , it looks like the blue pill , not so well , it looks like a cramped capsule , not so well , it looks like the needle .
and nothing of that has some really have pharmaceutical property . it 's only our think , the in us a greater impact on .
i wanted to know if i do this idea for a trick could use .
i suspect something , that obviously a deception is , and making it 's really look .
we know , yes , from the study , you to the needle to reach to , if it on the thing to do .
this is a 18 two feet long <unk> . you is very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you first a little bit to render time .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin and bite , you through and , until you on the other side bounce back <unk> .
if you very bad will -- if they easily in famished and fall -- i think that 's a few friends , the last night in the hotel room , demonstrated , and some people , i did n't know , and it 's a woman , he 'd become .
i 'm so , if you very quickly evil , then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part of back here .
you can it 'll see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my flesh to start , the bottom of my <unk> i 'm just a small one puncture , do .
i do , i really sorry . makes you go crazy ?
and now just a little bit by my skin and the other side , so back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation , we do the <unk> had .
about .
but now , my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . that 's a , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , is certainly not so stupid and <unk> , the skin , just to us a few minutes long to talk . ''
now , then i 'm it 'll show you .
look like that from here ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and the people back , `` okay . i think that 's not right . ''
the people in the <unk> come from now in .
they let 's me give them from the near the time .
that 's really my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
that 's my meat , and i can that 's swivel around .
i do , i 'm sorry . if you an evil , you look away , look not .
the people back or the , that later , eventually , on video to see , will say , `` well , see that , yes , impressive , but if it 's really would , he would -- you see here 's a hole and there , if it really , would , it to bleed . ''
okay , they let me a little blood for you <unk> .
yes , here is it .
normally would i now the needle out .
i would my arm safe and show you , there 's not , which are .
but i think , in an experiment here and with the intention , from a deception something real to do , i 'm the needle just in there , let me and so of the stage to go .
we 're going in the next days , some time to face .
i hope , you look forward , already on . thank you .
everybody talks about today about happiness . .
i have some people the books just let the , `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years published , and they after about 40 , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest , happiness , explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people are happier .
but despite all of tide of work , there 's several different cognitive fall , it , almost impossible to do , about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive fall .
that is true for a layman 's the her own happiness is think , and it is for scientists , the lucky to think that , because it turns out , we just as much mess that are like every other .
the first of pop into this is a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns , out to the word `` happiness is simply not a useful in the word , is , because we do it on to many different things to use .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , the we do it to be , but in the great and all that 's something , that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated , would have to the well-being is .
the second case is a confuse of experience and memory , in basically consists of you between be happy in his life and be happy about to live or happy with his life .
and this are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea from happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the way the fact , we 're not about a situation that can think , the well-being , , without its importance to warp .
i mean , that 's a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way , it right , to get .
now i would like with an example , start of someone , a <unk> had to of my lectures , a story was . [ unclear ... '' ] , he said , he had a symphony of , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and the very end of this , there 's a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put he 's add , really quite an emotionally , that has the whole experience ever ruined .
but that was n't .
what it had all , the memories , the experience .
he had the experience i had .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care ca n't , because he with a memory <unk> was ; the memory that was ruined , and the memory that was all , what he had to keep going to get had .
what we really that says , is that we 're talking about us and about other people think we could in terms of two types of itself .
there 's a <unk> , that in the present to live and the present , if you know , is able to the back to experience , but , just the present .
it 's the <unk> , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` do now it hurts , when i do you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of life up , to get , and it 's your teammates , that the doctor 's been by he the question . it , `` how we have you in the last time that feel ? ''
or `` how was their journey to albania ? '' or a similar .
this are two very different entities , that <unk> , and that <unk> , and the two to confuse this is part of the <unk> of exploring the lucky .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really begin with a basic reaction on our memories , -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not only tell stories , if we wanted to make the stories to tell .
our memory , tells us stories , that is , what we of our experiences , keep allowed is a story .
and let you <unk> with an example , start .
there 's an old one study .
that are real patients , a painful procedure into place .
i 'm not the really go . you today is not more painful , yet it was painful , as this study in the 1990s was done .
they were asked , all over 60 seconds about their pain to cover .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're going to ask : `` who of these people has more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
a b has the more suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought that these patients , you suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise ,
and the surprise is the patient is a in a lot <unk> <unk> , <unk> had as a b .
the stories <unk> were different , and because a very big part of the story is , ends up --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but a sort of them is this , the ...
but a sort of them is the worse than the other .
and the , the worse is it , where the pain , the end on his peak . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we these people after their <unk> ask you have , and also , `` how it was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and she was much worse for a , as well , b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a direct conflict between the <unk> , and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even had to b is a <unk> time .
now , what you with the patient is a , you could do , and we actually now done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a life by you just the hose in it makes no way to very , him to shake up .
that is going to the patient who has , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long does , does that the <unk> itself from the patient is a bad on this is , and you , does that the <unk> itself from the patient is a lot better on this is , because now , your patient is a in a better story about his experience , given .
what 's driving them being a story from ?
and that is for the stories , the memory of us that provides and it is also for the stories , we invent .
what 's driving , a story i think are these cases , great moments , and the end .
and end are , really important , and in this case <unk> the end .
so , that <unk> even live to live in continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , after the other .
and they say , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're for always been lost .
i mean , the most moments of life -- and i do that does -- you know , the psychological present the other than about three seconds long . what i mean , you know , it in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , the most of you leave no lane .
the most of you will completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet , they kind of the impression that they count to , what during this brief moments of <unk> happens to our lives .
it 's the finite resource , we use as we 're in the world .
and how we they consume it would seem to be important , but that 's not the story , that <unk> even for us to keep .
so we do this <unk> , and that <unk> , and they 're really quite different .
the difference between them is the interacting with time .
of view of <unk> , if you a vacation have and the second one week , well , is how the first , is the <unk> vacation at twice as well so how the <unk> vacation .
so it does it 's not for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation 's hardly any more than the <unk> away , because there is no new memories , which will .
they have the story does n't changed .
and on this way is time , the critical variable , a <unk> itself is one of a <unk> itself . time has a very short on this story .
so , that <unk> itself , more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually your teammates , that make is true , because if you a patient who have the , we say , two <unk> at two different kinds of surgeons had and , decide , which he would choose to , is the , the votes of the memory , the less bad thing is , and this is the surgeon , selected will .
that <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
actually we choose not between these are . we choose between the memories , experiences .
and even if we , the future thinking , we think , our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
and , can you look at , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> , and you , that <unk> even think more than one , that , that <unk> even <unk> through experience , that <unk> even do n't need .
i have the impression that if we need to the very often the case is , that is , we do on vacation largely sitting in a little bottle of <unk> itself .
and that 's a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
that 's a kind of explanations , the dominance of <unk> even gave everyone .
and when i think about , i think , a vacation , we 're going on a few years in antarctica . have made , clearly the best on was , i ever had , and i think is often , in the relationship to how often , i other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory . <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever since the folder has opened , with the 600 of it , i would have a another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are at a half hours .
there was it 's a get it .
now , i like a little extremely be , so you know , how little it says , i on the <unk> of memories of have , but itself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we these be ?
so i want you to talk about a thought experiment to think .
imagine , you want their next to ago , you know , the end <unk> all their pictures <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug , so that the n't remember that .
now , you to the same to vote ?
and if you a other to vote would , there 's a conflict between your two types of itself and they have to think about , this conflict to decide , and that 's really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories , think you could have a different answer .
why we the <unk> choose , we chose this is a problem , that , we do it with a choice between the two types of itself .
now , the two types of even look at two words from happiness .
there 's actually two concepts , from happiness , we can use , one per itself .
so they can ask : how happy , is that <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how are happy the moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- lucky enough for those moments , is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured can be ?
and the way , we 're now capable of a pretty good idea to get from happiness , the <unk> even the time .
if you after the lucky , the <unk> even asking it 's a very different thing .
that 's not of the happy as a person who lives .
it 's of the content , or having the person is , if this person about her life i think .
very different .
everybody , these words , not from going to the exploration of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of explorers about comfort , exploration of happiness long screwed that have on exactly this kind .
the distinction between the lucky , the <unk> , and the average happiness the <unk> itself is in the last years , i realized that 's been , and now she would you , both individual to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , more than half a million people ask the been are now , what you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another group effort in the direction .
in the last few years , so we started , about happiness . the two types of itself to learn .
and the main thing that , we , i think , have learned is , they really different .
you can know , how happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not much about how to be happy , he was to live lives and vice versa .
just to make them a sense of the correlation to convey the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is , if you who would meet and you would tell you , oh , to his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size know ?
now , it would do something about its size , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them , someone be life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about how to be happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what the average happiness the <unk> .
we know that the money is very important , goals are very important .
we know , you 're lucky , basically means , very pleased to be with people , we like the time to spend with people , we like .
there 's other occupational pleasure , but that 's dominant .
so if you that happiness , the two types of itself as actually want you will look at very different things do .
the implication of the right here i said , to have is , we 're lucky , really not going to be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , a another reason , of that we 're not clear about happiness can think is , we 're not on the same things look if we talk about the life thinking , and if we actually life .
so if you the simple to ask yourself , how happy the people in california are you will not the correct answer .
if you ask this question you think that the people in california , happy to be if you , we say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is , if you about that live in california to think you think , the difference between california , and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
now , it turns , out to climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful , that decide , how happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful , which is responsible , you the end -- some people might the end to california .
and it 's sort of interesting to catch , what happens with people , to california to the hope , happier .
now , you <unk> itself is not happy .
we know that .
but a thing will happen . they 're going to think , you happier , are , because if you think about you going on it reminds us to be , how terrible at the weather in ohio . and they 're going to feel you to the right decision met .
it 's very difficult , about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i do you a sense of that , how it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question you .
thank you .
now , as we 're going on a few weeks , the phone , have mentioned before they told me , that , a pretty interesting result , that from this <unk> survey , came .
that 's something , what they appear to participate , let me , because they now a few minutes left would have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think , the most the thing that we in the <unk> survey found have is a number , we absolutely not to expect .
we found that in terms on happiness . the <unk> itself .
if we were watching the emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns , out to be under a minimum income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very big a sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a great representative sample , under a minimum income of over 600,000 dollars ,
60,000 .
dk : look .
60,000 dollars , are the people happy , and they are increasingly less and the poorer , they 're going .
so , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
what happens is obvious that the money , no <unk> an , but that lack of money , certainly do we bought , and we can make this do , really clear to measure .
in terms of the other , the <unk> , you get a different story .
the more money you 've made more work is you .
that is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american an it 's going to live , freedom , the quest to happiness .
when people that makes them take seriously , you know , i mean , it 's all the head to ask , everything , what we think , for instance , in terms of the policy and so forth .
there 's a chance to politicians that the country , generally a complementary finding out how the take seriously , and based on that politics , would make us ?
dk : you know , i think that , for it 's for the role of <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk does it 's you just and in other countries what they 're now .
the people are , recognizing that , they 're lucky to think should , if you , politics , thinking .
it is a while it , and the people will discuss them , if you <unk> study to , or whether they <unk> to do , so we need to this discussion is pretty soon .
how you 're lucky to increase , it 's very differently depending on them , thinking and if you know , that <unk> even think , or if you know , that <unk> even think .
that is politics can control , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> the population to measure .
that is , i think , in the next , or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it strikes me , this is subject , or should at the most important political debate , to be the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i <unk> games .
i think now for 10 years , online . and my goal for the next decade is , it as easy to make the world in the reality to save , in <unk> to save .
i have a design for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play a bigger and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` that 's a whole time for games . ''
maybe something to much time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve .
but in fact , my research at the center for the future holds that , is exactly the opposite <unk> .
three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to the most problems of the world to solve .
in fact , i am convinced , that , if we have the next century on this planet to do , we do this time to dramatically increase .
i work out that the issue took time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week .
that 's first maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so it , can : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity really want to , i think , we need to try to play online for at least , 21 billion hours per week to the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture of quite right , why i believe that the games , so critical for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a her the photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings of the play catch . so , on the players have a camera put up .
this is one of the classic scars of the play .
if you do n't players are , suppose you might be some of nuances in this picture .
you probably this sense for the urgency , something that fear , but also imagine your concentration , one in the solutions to one really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances . here , to go up <unk> eyes and the mouths are a sign of the optimism . the eyebrows down to surprise .
this is a player , the edge of so-called distilled victory .
oh , you know that . ok , well . so we have some outstanding players .
a <unk> the force is a result , that very positive is , before we ca n't know , it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you it , they 're shocked , in fact , something that are capable . that 's a <unk> victory .
this player 's a moment ago , distilled the force .
and this is it , what we 're on millions of their faces of <unk> the world to see to , if we are the next century in attacking . the face of those , as well , all odds on the one distilled victory .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , if we difficult problems to face .
i call it as the `` in life , i feel bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that i am , like , `` in life , i feel bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti and in my former head home , california , where i in my ph.d fact , why we in playing games are better than in real life .
that 's a problem , that many football players have .
we think , we in the reality is not so well , are like in play .
and i 'm not only less successful , though that to do anything .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean well in the case with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to deal with each other .
if we in a <unk> are , i think , many of us , in our best of them into , anytime and immediately helpful 're going to have been the problem to try , so long as much needed , it after the failure to try .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we 're on those into the feeling , we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel so by . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in play there 's just they do n't .
and this is it , what i was a student to look at .
why is it in play an impossible to think , you could n't simply reach it all ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality to ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideals that environment , made a problem solving it .
and i have some things that the epic counties that in <unk> so possible .
so , first , if you in one of online games come into this , all , the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters , are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , and it immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission , perfectly to her current level of the game that , right ?
so do you that .
they get ever get a task , they do n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so to do better . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and about six months . it 's always very specific to find something to do .
and there 's tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , with you to their epic mission to conclude .
that we have in real life , not so simple , this sense , at a <unk> of employees are willing to look .
and there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have the hell of `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or heard `` plus-one emotional intelligence . ''
this constant feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage , leaving , i did n't , plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life , feedback .
so , the problem <unk> like the world of warcraft , is that it , basit and this is , anytime , the edge of distilled victory to stand , we 'd like our whole time in this <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
until now have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , so i spent the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to it 's time in context to see , ago <unk> million years , began our first <unk> tries to go .
the first upright became good primate and so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we 're now with play spend , the only a sense , when you , the time in the scale of human development , eyes , holding , which is .
but also be appropriate . because it , out , we , by we all of this time to play using the fact that change , what we as people in the able to .
we 're going to us to all business , very much beings .
this is the truth . that i think .
at once they this thing about statistics , the recent graduating from a canopy researchers around the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons :
first , once , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> , you in the school spend , of the fifth . grade to school , and the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we here 's a complete <unk> , the young people as learning , what it means , a good poker player , like all other , in the school .
and may have some of them the new book of encountering malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
they built on the great to the <unk> , that , if we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> to come out of any subject to the 21st century . by spending , we 're going to coming in it .
we are so good at the idea that to the most people the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people , the <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are the players are really good ? ''
because if we that out could , if we have sort of the way that never been there <unk> human potential to .
so many people we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
this are our <unk> . 500 million people , the extraordinary , well , `` something '' .
and the next decade we have a another billion players , the extraordinary , well , what that are .
if you do it 's still do n't have heard ,
the games are evolved <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started to go to look what it is , at us these games to coming .
here are the four things , i found . the first thing : <unk> .
ok , imagine if you like the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is the desire , immediately to do something , a challenge to coming , together with the , that we have a <unk> hope kept on success .
players who believe , it , <unk> the force is possible , and that it , worth , it to try , and it .
players are not sit around .
players are masters in spiders , the social nets .
there 's a lot more interesting research , to show that we people more like , after we do with you have played , even if you us the ills of the defeated correctly .
the reason for this is that , a lot of trust it requires , with somebody a game to play .
we trust to someone time with us over the rules <unk> be , we did the goal , and to stats and stay .
so the technologies that we see that grow out of ties , trust and each other .
as a result of that we build greater understanding social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week he plays , as <unk> .
the reason is , if we play , we 're actually be happier , hard to work , as if we wanted to relax , or do nothing .
we know , we as human beings can work , if we were hard , where they work done .
and the players are always ready , hard to work , if you the right to get .
and ultimately , very epic , meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> got to be .
here 's a <unk> the into the right light to back . you know . we all of wikipedia , the <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , almost over 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft the 've seen as about some of another issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , to a single result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it are people , believe , as a single change the world .
and the only problem is , you believe , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the problem , that i 'm going to try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he looked at , why people so much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to the idea of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that of an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he says ...
not so how i -- i think of games , i 'm doing something <unk> .
so he says , that makes actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> more , as in real life .
you can in play more powerful social ties with each other than in real life . they get more valuable feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says , it is completely obvious thing , the players are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i voice first time to , that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to start , the real world in a game to turn them .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years , guess .
there 's this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
ago , these fantastic controllers , there 's <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of people who developed <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the greek <unk> <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about , and why games have invented .
according <unk> were playing games , more <unk> , in the <unk> as a famine .
supposedly , there 's such a great famine , the king of <unk> , to a crazy idea i decided that .
the people who suffered . the people who were .
it was a page of situation . you took a page of the solution .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . in one day would you eat . the next day you would play .
and they were as much in the <unk> one be , games , so fascinating these are and us with as , <unk> productivity by water , you remember that would , that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> they survive , for 18 years , famine , putting in one day , eating and the next was playing .
as well , i think , we use today , games .
we put play a cell to the suffering from the real world .
we put play a cell to everything to suppose , that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life , basit and this is , and we bring us what we need from the play .
but that does n't have to the end to be .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was to 18 years , the famine , not better . so i decided to the king , a last <unk> scale-up .
they did the kingdom , in two halves .
they were a <unk> and the winner got to a distilled adventure and it .
they left <unk> and made , the looking after a new home . they were just so many people , how it food to survive there and finding out with the rest after a area , in the they are able to .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , later that -- rich , would take the same dna , like the old <unk> have .
so the scientists recently to the notion , <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists found evidence of a global cooling , almost 20 years of it , what the famine to be .
so i could this crazy story to vote .
you might have actually their people through play rescued , , for 18 years in games , escaped have and then this as far , and so much about that playing with each learned , by the whole civilization .
so , that we can also .
we play since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we 're playing with 16 years of warcraft .
i think , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half of civilization depended on the looking after a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> the burning half of us an hour a day with play spend , until we the problems with the real world have solved .
i know , they 're going to say , `` how we 're solving problems of the real world in play ? '' and exactly that question i mean work in the last years at the center for the future is devoted to .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it back there of how we the future , you should .
we do n't want to try and the future , before to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best result , imagine . and then people to powerful , this idea in the reality of doing .
we imagine epic counties ago , and give people the ways , you to achieve .
i 'll show you very short , three games , i designed to have to try to people that epic counties in their own future to give yourself .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
and the game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , you a <unk> get yourself .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> to make it for them , realistic , and you 're real life in fact , without oil . so , if you to play and register , they tell us , where you live . and then get you <unk> in real , to show you how much oil costs , what 's not there , like food security with this is the transportation , with going to school closed are , whether it in the there . and you to figure out how you 're real life make , if it would be . and we ask you , about to blog , videos or the photos -- to .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 . and we have you ever since the last three years traveling with .
and i can tell you , it was a changing the experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we do it should .
but if you , distilled adventures are and told you get , `` of us about the oil . ''
that 's a fascinating about adventure , on that you about .
they find out , survive , you . the most of players have the game <unk> habits , that it .
so we worked for the next <unk> play a bigger , at target into than just <unk> .
we have the game , `` <unk> '' at the center for the future .
point is the calculation of <unk> the people just , 23 years on the planet , and there .
this massive supercomputer called `` global <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the ourselves , players , sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it that `` <unk> '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just put together , they can save the world .
but in our basketball game , instead of the only five people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 player up playing the game 's eight weeks for .
they found out 500 incredibly creative solutions , you read , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , we look at 3 . march . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you the game to conclude , you off the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> '' the end by 2010 .
we 're working with the universities , sub-saharan africa and they invite a , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and his ingenuity .
i want you all invite , this game with young people to share , around the world , all , in <unk> , of benefits , together in their own social enterprises that had the world to save .
i am now , the end .
i want you ask .
what , you think , what happens when the next ?
we all these fantastic players , we have games , to know what we can do , but we have the real world still not be saved .
well , i hope you to me , agree , that players , human resources are , we need to work in real life can use , and that play a big meaning for change .
we all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability of social them to knit , <unk> and the desire to <unk> meaning .
i 'm really , we put together in history play games to knock on this planet , another century to survive .
and i hope , they 're going to me that play a design and play .
if i went into the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things not sure , that we have any <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games .
so i say , let the <unk> games to start !
thanks .
i 'd like to something about what to me , a few months , writing one article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have the writing , my <unk> our questions , but i was with the frontier of <unk> already done , and i fell on , i still never in my life <unk> have to the word `` the disabled , '' really means .
i read them the post .
`` the disabled , '' <unk> , `` <unk> , helpless , useless , destroyed , <unk> , thousands , <unk> , ended up , <unk> , from <unk> , is fission , ill , very , <unk> , paralyzed , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from the traffic moved , <unk> , and done , broken <unk> , <unk> , lo and also get hurt , ineffective and weak .
<unk> , healthy , strong , exquisitely sensitive . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and i 'll hear laughter , it seemed so ridiculous , but i was just to `` up '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and had to stop to read and i 'll just collecting , this <unk> <unk> and the order to <unk> emotional shock .
of course was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i 've told me just thought that the 've been pretty be old .
but actually it was a copy the early '80s , when i just with the school actually started and so began to my self outside of the family on building and to form , in terms of the other children and the rest of the world to me around .
and god was very much i was no <unk> .
i saw this one take seriously , i in a world was born , somebody like me as a person will perceive , whose lives in <unk> in positive , go . today , but i 'm going for the opportunity and adventure , i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated and expect , here a <unk> contribution to find .
here is the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
especially in shock to me the last two words , `` near <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not only to the words .
it 's about , what we think about the people think , we do with these words to describe .
it 's the values , in these words stuck , and how we these values them .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to around us .
many <unk> societies , including the the greeks , and the roman , have really believed that the way of <unk> a great force , because that , what you to <unk> , , <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a those people or a powerful people ?
just been a people <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , they 're not limit , and you ideas <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a person , for me to the has opened , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . chair dupont institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , of his name , you think , the most americans are not accurate about it could . so he was always , dr. c.p .
and dr. p. was always very colorful fly and was for the work with kids , just like water .
i found the time , i in hospital spent just have , just great -- until on my <unk> .
i had one will seem to be forever , again with these big fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> build . and i have this on more being vilified as everything else . i did they hated it . i they felt crucified . i 've they hated it .
and ask you ago , i actually , as <unk> kid with dr. p. , and that 's trying to this will help to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day , me in my favorite exercises that 's -- this will were just really tiring and mercilessly , and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're so a strong , powerful and young girl , you one day one of on the stitching .
and if it till you , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
course that was just a lot easier to trick of dr. p. , so i the will do , i 'm not to do , with the prospect of the richest five-year-old girl in the ward in the floor . but he has me in fact that brought to my daily <unk> with new eyes . they are so , it 's a new and <unk> experience .
and i ask me today , very his vision of me as strong and powerful young girl , my self being formed , and i was so imagine that was able to me as a kind of strong , powerful and <unk> person .
that 's just an example of you , like adults in <unk> the imagination of the work .
but how the already been quoted examples of the <unk> prove it , makes us our language , no room , , imagine , what we all want you know , it every single to themselves , as powerful people to see .
our language is behind the social changes who , in many cases , through a technological change that were .
the medical records from at you can kind of course , say , my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium and artificial <unk> , ranging from body , it will allow people , really all their opportunities to use and , about the borders , you your natural destiny , put it has to figure out to develop , not to speak of social <unk> platforms , to people , a own identity to give , on its own way , and the way that , and , with the world , to groups are choosing , where , choose .
maybe that 's so this technological change and clear , because i ever , it 's always been a other inconvenient truth , which , every man of society , something very <unk> and very powerful tool can give and that the human ability , adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability , which were -- that 's a very interesting story , because people to me , there 's not ask them to how i do with giving deal , and i 'm going to you something to confess , this sentence , for me never <unk> and i always very uncomfortable with it felt the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i do know , why .
this phrase from interacting with tremendous odds that lives of the idea that success or happiness of it depends , a challenge to coming , without any of the so on top experience of a designer . as if my life so successful go to be , because i the kinds fall of life with a prosthetic limb of it could , like that people to me with my disability to perceive .
but the truth is , we change . course , we 're talking about the challenge of a designer , no matter whether you physically , emotional , or even the two days .
and i would , that 's good .
odds are not an obstacle , that we <unk> to be able to collaborate with our lives better clear to come .
odds are just to our lives .
and i 've been used to giving them as my shadow .
sometimes i realize , he 's very mind is , sometimes he is barely able to see , but he 's constantly at me .
and i want to do the impact , or obstruction . the heavy the <unk> of people , degrading .
there 's in life odds and challenges , that are just <unk> real and each person 's so different . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds , come to or , but how we going to clear to come .
so we 're not just for granted , the people would we love , ago <unk> to keep , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we turn our kids do n't like , if we do you feel that they give to do n't want to the way .
you have to two things , of them : one thing , the medical fact , an to be and the other the social about that , if i as i 'm or not .
and to be honest , the only real and you 're being disabled , i took apart , had , is that the world , the time , says , you can take me with these other definitions describe .
in our desire , the people to protect , the heart , are and you the cold , hard to the truth about their medical a lot to communicate or even a forecast the quality to ask , they expected , we need to pay attention , we 're not the really going to put them , somebody actually be disabled .
maybe there is the current policy of the only to pay attention , in a broken , is , and how do we fix , for every single a lot more profound disability than the pathology , .
if we have a people do n't <unk> treat , and not all his evil forces and opportunities to perceive and that path , who do in addition to the natural struggle , you may lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a people , for our society , a value .
so we need to the <unk> look out and us on all the human possibilities to focus .
the most important , but is that , between the perception of pushing and our great human ingenuity , a connection there .
we should , challenging the better not <unk> or in denial , we should n't try to you to avoid , we should you among the carpet return , but it 's about , in the odds of opportunity to recognize .
it 's me , perhaps more about , to ask , we 're giving these are not get to , but that we do that is open , are , you to hug , and seize to stick to also time a <unk> to use and maybe even trying to dance .
and maybe we do it , giving them as something natural , coherent and useful to see , and we feel so through their presence not , had .
the year in a celebration , we 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human character , pointing out .
i would it 's so what , not the most of its way to survive , and also not the <unk> its way , but the , the , changes the question is adapt .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , the battle of human spirit . we is , by conflict to turn .
so , again , change and are the greatest skills .
and maybe we know , , from which the wood and we imperfections that are , if we really have to be .
that 's exactly that the point of giving , a perception of these eyes , a feeling for our own power .
we can be so even something like to give them .
so we 're giving a new meaning to the heavy time out about .
maybe we giving a change .
odds are for a change , the we still do n't have adapted .
i think , the biggest neurological damage , we even more caring have , is to believe , we 're normal to be .
time to be honest , who is normal ?
there 's not normal .
there 's the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and you to do this poor , this person who really know , learn to , if it they really there ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality , a different kind of ways , or the strength to knock it , a little bit dangerous to think , when we could . so we can the forces of very many kids to release and you to invite , very particular , and precious and skills in the society today .
<unk> have that we found , we people of the members of our society , one by have , useful to be and a contribution to do .
it there are going to , the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with the depths of physical injuries , have worn and that was perhaps , because the life in <unk> of people for the society value was ,
they have these people not as a broken and useless to look at ; they were as something special , and those are treated .
ago , a few years i went around the city , in the i grew up was , in a <unk> in the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there , a <unk> from .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , says , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i ended up to me , and i see these elders . i had no idea who he 's .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i can do n't let me , you . ''
and he said , `` well , you may , did n't wait , i remember .
when i they first time to saw , i do you from the belly of her mother got . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , it , but then they click .
that was dr. <unk> , a man , i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i course , very typical , to my birthday , two weeks to it came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mom was in on , and so i knew my parents of the man , the me to the world . and , all .
and because i without <unk> was born , and my feet , after them pointing , and i just a toes , and a few toes in the other foot , he was the <unk> , of strangers to the bad news was a spectacular .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents say , you never walk , would , and never been so you look inside , would like the other children or that you never a completely to live , could , and since they have to me simply lying <unk> . ''
really exceptional , i found , he <unk> my entire childhood now , no matter , if i at a <unk> in the second grade , won had to what i do with the <unk> at the mermaid parade , <unk> along was , no matter , if i my transplant fellowship , or of my <unk> counties <unk> had , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of <unk> the x amount of the potential of human , willing .
you can just not enough to point , how critical of a factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> she goes on , he said , `` i learned to kids , if you do n't always something else said , you get , and also if you just a support to get to actually children , <unk> , you can children , very much . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has to be thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone to deal , two different things are .
and also i quit my thinking over the time has changed , if you me the age of 15 years to ask you have to what i mean who against the legs of meat and bone and switched to have , i would have no one second <unk> .
i was going to make normal work .
if you me that today , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs , but i 've and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this in also happen , because i so many people are faced 'm going to the me the door opened have , instead of people to face , i do or me a little idea on wanted .
you see , it takes a really , people , you a demonstration , their forces <unk> , and they 're going through .
if you it 's someone in the his own , inside of forces to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for anyone in a critical moment a door busts open , then they 're looking for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them at themselves , the doors to open .
the importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means , something to produce , in this is the potential <unk> .
again , which the potential to do we want , access ?
in the '60s years was in a <unk> done . then were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` music downloads <unk> '' in the we call that as `` <unk> . ''
the students going to music is it .
and the a student will <unk> harder to report , the better teacher , .
they have then about a <unk> period of students with a `` well enough , '' the top grade , `` very well , '' gave them . it was told you , they were <unk> , very clever would . and after these three months have you really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> it in the heart to hear the way around the <unk> was told , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months .
but only those , still in the school were -- apart from the students , the school , throwing had .
very crucial in this trial was the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers wo n't know , something changed .
you was just said to be the student and that are the students with the note enough . and as you have you something about teaching and they 're treated .
the only really profound disability is a broken mind is a spirit , the broken , has no hope . he find nothing more beautiful . he 's our natural , one of curiosity . and our innate capacity to the imagination .
if we do it , but to create the human spirit , to support to continue to hope , and other people to , around you to find , and <unk> to be then we use our natural forces that really positive .
if a mind about these qualities that , we can be a new reality and new <unk> create .
i want with a poem end , that of a persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written , and of the me my friend , jacques <unk> told . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words , if you know . '' `` every child knows , not the god the name , not the god of being banned , but the god , the only four words , if you know , and this time , he says , only : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thank you .
