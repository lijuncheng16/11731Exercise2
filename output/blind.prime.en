yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
very much , thanks for the invitation pops up here today to talk .
and i have to me , now themselves , imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , even term , <unk> at the food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one them , and second largest organization , , the public .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and yes , that makes you , not very popular .
i know .
and it out , and that 's something what my son , particularly like , i also <unk> .
it means that i 'm the head of the <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and have i thought , course , is a subject matter , i do you today <unk> want .
which , the subject <unk> , because also heard that the fire .
we hope for the best and <unk> us on the worst , that has jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i start something not , so serious obligation to say .
i <unk> you a able to .
so we talk , if it 's a risk , there , we briefly , a stand , for example <unk> <unk> , the rush .
many people are way .
it will push , it <unk> .
and somewhere on the is a suitcase , lonely , left , something <unk> , maybe <unk> with .
nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any .
suddenly a <unk> .
, that <unk> .
the police comes to fire , <unk> .
people out .
who <unk> .
they go out .
what 's because this ? to ask passersby .
that we know , not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
children cry .
some of the fall , maybe even , because it all very quickly go to .
a sudden , who failed .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic is breaking out .
i am now here on .
the rest of bastards i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> . <unk> ?
exactly that 's ago in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's such a suitcase are stuck .
afterwards , , out to just , in <unk> , nine billion pounds of drugs at were .
but the people were just as , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building them .
it was n't told .
and it came right , who , at least in the group on the my friend , my friend , i was .
god was very much is n't panic that have , otherwise would all that are not so safe to get out how it .
you see , in a descriptions , in a <unk> disaster is communication in a very important .
communication is so important because the people at this it came to communication <unk> .
they want to know what 's because it .
they used in the good , the time was that for the authorities , simple .
we 've just ca n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because it 's called the <unk> and there .
you , with this fair to say , the people get in panic , say , we would n't like the truth or we say the <unk> .
that 's in a time the social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time of <unk> and public television is not more possible .
simply and really , so , because it 's one is not be moral is and second most are doing anyway , the past when the agency , the event that report .
you remember , may still , the one in the hudson river , ago , is a few year , here .
the first are about it came at twitter .
of someone , on a ferry over and it was simply and really , immediately <unk> , here 's a plane <unk> and we save the people now .
that was no <unk> .
you see , we 're dependent on the world today is simply and really , of place , and the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because most are we course , the past , supposedly , the truth know , because we as the agency to course , to pay attention , we just <unk> information , too .
that are public media , or , private media , either that 's not very thought , or they do it just also not .
of so , we 're going in the food , and that 's also something that , even by the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and to do we going to the good old <unk> back out .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
it means that we 're going in the next few years about a hundred <unk> in the <unk> build the , some of you know that still , <unk> , if it just to <unk> coming .
they used it was so .
you may know , if you , three times , once , once a long and even just means .
i know it .
we 're going to the right now in the human beings with all <unk> , we , have , so <unk> , facebook , twitter , the radio <unk> also at the television and all the internet and the local media and so , and immediately , to the course , with <unk> to pick up at the information on to get .
and we know , we need to there 's very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to there 's very quickly and <unk> inform them , because the re-educate ourselves and citizens to be otherwise frightened .
and we ultimately , not more that , what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one a question of the speed , about all media , to stand , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
the credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the re-educate ourselves and citizens to say , either , oh , the proportion time again , everything is not , they say , the <unk> us , it 's all much worse than it in fact is .
we have that 's also good experience to be done with facebook and twitter , more going on recently .
also that you may have some of in them the media from .
we have a <unk> in the food <unk> had .
and it 's a thing called the chemical bomb .
that are bombs , with a <unk> <unk> are , because the should just once did n't do the first would say , the <unk> explode , but by the houses in the second world war <unk> and just at the ground , because of a chemical in response , by going to a little metal , the <unk> <unk> two <unk> of another , so that the , <unk> , and then it to blast .
the problem is just , many of the suitcase bombs have never works and are , like , in <unk> under things in the food <unk> .
and there were we of a few years older gentleman , the be some extent , he 's so beautiful in the turnaround , to wanted , we were now , he had seen how they <unk> forty-three like it 's and now <unk> , the about one of , there 's a bomb . laughter throughout the background .
the way since i have to acquire multiple older and gentlemen , who 's the whole <unk> .
we 're going to see what we still find everything .
these roadside bombs to immediately , place , not have defused , but in fact that .
and so we then in <unk> park simply and really , a , in every sense of the word , a bomb , exploding .
and the first time in the history of the city of the communications , facebook and twitter , let it run with the consequence that the entire <unk> far over <unk> <unk> total followed .
and the media were thrilled . laughter in the background .
we had n't even with where the phone , but the have <unk> and <unk> , everything about <unk> and twitter .
all that had a great effect for us , because the credibility that is dominated by increased about these social media .
just so , they have to me also a sign give , when i stop to .
i can go from here 's not , the watch out .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media , the advantage we have to you very , too .
not so very <unk> are , because the members of the there are or the <unk> , they called , a high <unk> .
secondly , fast we 've done .
if anything not true , writes that someone who immediately , so the credibility of the whole thing i just talked to have , clearly going up , because that the entire community in principle , the reports in this is .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if anything that 's wrong , it also very quickly to correct .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> the exciting found , like a bomb , in <unk> park , up .
of so we from all the things , in the last years happened are , and it are much more <unk> happens as intense encounter a still think , as intense encounter a white .
also the food , every day of such a home for worse .
a bomb , in fact to be in a park , is certainly not such a .
but they can also , and also then <unk> we now , in <unk> be found , and then i 'm we there with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , you think , munich , you think , other cities , if the then up to say , because you just something called a <unk> , the you have conventional or not to defuse that can , then we know , right now , a variety of houses , not , look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it just in a in a world <unk> <unk> at which is necessary , communication to do to that i also turns out to stop to stand for about to the people to are to stand for about to the people in the are able to , these difficult situation -- to .
and the social media to help us also , credible , because ultimately , they all , the communications are involved , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , still in the <unk> , big part .
of so now is <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross were etc. , but of communication in the catastrophe and with a catastrophe about us all .
and <unk> that , shown .
there 's about twitter and , facebook , a lot of the help gone , if you also partially destroys you still with the kind was , because suddenly <unk> of people have any <unk> build to and you did n't even more , where the <unk> .
the life , there 's still much to do , indeed , the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented amount of solidarity with the <unk> and the <unk> has just shown that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more to think .
and i hope , you a little more convinced of you have to this media , that yes , for the beautiful things of life often is used to also in <unk> its meaning and purpose of and that we as a city , the flight , <unk> charge is , this instrument living in the future , and then , new , and very different as well be able to their , to the citizens to the re-educate ourselves and citizens and so the end i now , and thank me very much for your attention , i do you have the time , barely seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , like you just heard already have .
and i 'm now , they also still , a own <unk> to the reasons .
what it is , there <unk> produce 'm going to that i 'll ask them , the same time ago .
before i do that , i must but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i think , we mean , i really to life .
that we without the stories that i could live .
and i believe that , very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as the entertainment business actually produced .
then i think , that the internet , the infinite series of africa , of fact that well as anybody <unk> really neat <unk> will .
and four , i 'm <unk> convinced of the people that were created , to be creative .
and that you happier , are , once you 'll be creative .
the more people are happy , the better , it 's the world .
very obvious .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the firing line , i am , already said , a storyteller .
and the story , i tell you want to begin to midnight poised in a affinities and , in the just happy <unk> the screen .
that 's <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get you of the disposition on and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , it strikes midnight 's become , something happens with her .
it 's something in your head , in your body , with their perception .
and they did n't really words .
they do n't know , there just happened .
i 've all the same words .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see the a side <unk> and look in <unk> and everything is pretty stark white .
i , and feel that i 'm kind pretty <unk> .
<unk> .
and the other side , we had the two , then in in oz -- with very very much color .
and it was , in the first , that i 'd better <unk> and write , as that i draw .
so the first of the <unk> now with their new perceptions , you see , is a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the ago , is , you very seriously at , and says , very much , congratulations , your life is over .
that 's <unk> .
and <unk> it <unk> about it on , to a very special kind of people .
she was as <unk> born .
players are people , from their <unk> 've got to your lifetime to play anymore .
of you who knows <unk> ?
very good .
imagine if you , <unk> at <unk> n't swords , if you stack them to meet , but <unk> from the pocket .
so these cube , <unk> , <unk> , everything possible .
what really important is the players have no insight on their <unk> .
we know , yes , not , when we die .
i wish that every a long life , but we know what 's just not .
it can also the morning , everything , over to be .
and so it 's in my players , you .
you know what do n't want to how they because actually can play .
that , and again , every lost minute , at the last have to be .
a player , his entire lifetime , we think , <unk> in the moment of <unk> like a candle at the <unk> will .
now you can , of course , if that because that is dangerous , why are playing the then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without any players to a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only when a player does , he 's actually alive .
the were to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how they now the world of players <unk> , your first of it , and , of course , inevitably , in <unk> love , is the story , i tell you want .
and it in the form of <unk> .
the first season has 12 to follow , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens , i just to be late seen .
so , twelve follow the first season , with a total length of one five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result , after the other , beautiful <unk> told , that you know .
that television , for its <unk> nothing else .
that 's not new .
and if it 's all be , if only , i now one is finished .
and also do n't here .
now let 's but , we started .
we go , to <unk> back .
what 's the most set of the movie or from the series ?
it can just a way to see , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that have .
and that 's exactly true on my players , which is not to .
of it can create a very many give them .
there 's so many different games .
it you just , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so , and so on .
and , <unk> 's also the number , the players .
and so the exceptions here of stories , all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who is because everything about ?
i , already quite a high think of me .
i think give me for sufficient smart and extremely creative .
but i know , hundreds of brains more to produce as just one , it 's mine .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the process of pulling in .
what would , if we <unk> not just how we worship , or to allow us , but even <unk> ?
so if you says , we invite you very very much , the development of this <unk> with the thing .
imagine if you , one example , in the result , three up a <unk> the they 're totally class find , because he you for example , your grandfather of .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just , today , the technology is that yes , do n't even more so hard to a <unk> do .
and this they invite the <unk> up , where it then right , and that 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience that will .
that is , it 's not anywhere in , but it goes on the right there , where it up to .
that really nice thing is , we the internet .
and the internet , yes , really do it .
so , every medium is kind of the light .
that means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , turn , that they do want .
and if we now , again this structure that .
that looks <unk> bit of <unk> web , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced of the internet was born to pick exactly this kind of stories to tell .
it do , unfortunately , not so many , or at one .
so , now go , i but even still a step further and making the audience ourselves to the player .
because in a <unk> .
there , against the characters from the series 'd but also against people in the real environment , well , and this <unk> on your phone .
deduce the news here , you know . we also all very well , are so , mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful areas , just very rapidly developing .
and the i do n't go can , because i else again , 20 minutes i 'd need .
we ca n't know .
everybody 's time it 's composed of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i became part of the jury of the moment , i have to that just see , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me as the price for the best <unk> given .
and i have to say , this jury did was all of legislators of the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so those moments people , you want to my .
and when i the convince you can , here with my : the internet right use the narrative structures to revolutionize the way , still better world , i think , i can really , convince them .
so .
everybody 's time on this : why is the whole , so ?
because i 've been alone in the names all areas that covered up .
we have of the first of the <unk> , who is it , i 'm on , you 're on , everybody 's time .
now , then that die .
in the series will be very much .
everybody 's time it means : everyone to time to die .
and then of course also , everybody 's time on in terms of everyone can be part , when he said that i want .
that 's me totally good .
i come , in terms of the <unk> and there 's nothing worse i consider to , as if it 's so a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you know .
if you in the theater , are and then comes the actor , in the auditorium and all , oh god , please now , not me .
and that 's just not .
so it 's fame of interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just the viewer can be .
the reason why i german , speaking is the , the project , german , will be the first place .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while , along and i was , asking : do that , but on english , they 're the bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , comes the spanish , and then the german .
now it 's not so , when i would we in some little by moving .
and i really really really , if it also other people that 's like me that the people to be grateful , for something , that 's not by any <unk> <unk> , where the end , then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> .
if that everything that 's one , i it would have , about the result now the first this <unk> online .
and if you now , why i 'm here at a <unk> , where it , under the headline <unk> worth <unk> .
that i also a couple of thoughts .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite on the amount of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .
and i can really just say , this all know , incredibly important is , and incredibly <unk> .
but it uses , everything is nothing , if you 's not apply them .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just time , all taken 've got the , i learned .
and it applied .
and so far it 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if you now , anybody thinks , i want to have been my part that , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i `` ai drawing <unk> cartoon , or what that , that 's also now .
you find us , the internet .
on facebook .
great , free the speaker .
yes , <unk> , too .
welcome to , you can memories are wiping out ?
question , you .
you can memories are wiping out ?
can you , because , all remember , in your life ever happen is ?
they still <unk> forget it ?
who has who can , all remember that ?
it go to do n't hands up .
so you memories are wiping out ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , so simple , we want it gets us today is n't do .
and then i would be the talk , probably quite a minute .
again a good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today , tonight , i 've chosen , because he 's two of my passions , or my two great love down at connecting .
i ' , here in the near the computer , studied and i did , i just with the bits and of bytes of busy finding the world today is that big through the world .
and <unk> certain time i 'm now , as a coach , and consultation , in private and professional capacity in his way .
the a side , i so , with the computer , very much too , the other side , i 'm currently , in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that one that that the human beings ?
how can because that change ?
the to a comparison two .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about an artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can build a computer , the works , like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we already quite close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer need that .
but , let me time i do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> little kid needs .
so the comparison directly between the computer on the a side and our brain on the other side .
if we the computer to take , then based yes , everything , so your smart , you a tablet , you <unk> and also these cameras and all of all these smart refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he called , cpu , central <unk> <unk> .
these are parts , all of <unk> transistors .
the word has certainly , everybody gets heard and in <unk> it will always been so as a triangle , of .
that <unk> little device , that has three ports , and forth accordingly electricity , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we , i 've got the extra <unk> ago about five hundred million of little parts .
and the turn out there 's crazy , mess .
we store the things , we we can calculate the things , we had degrees ' , and albert einstein said to hear , yes , 'n computer can all you can be very much , very quickly , but actually he can just zero and one that .
more he can do n't .
he 's actually quite a nerdy stuff .
we want 's time you compare with our brain .
our brain , as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , there , i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in front of gray matter of up here in there .
the nice , but is , our our neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but the have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion .
that are 10 with 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , you see , the complexity of the brain is to make a higher than that , what we now , when computers .
we want to the <unk> time that , maybe the , or other people know of the first supercomputer that had their own power next door to stand , ha , who were , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and the is , and that is , in the equivalent of two big selling bananas , so more you do n't and you do you would be up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> giant good part up here , <unk> giant good calculator with <unk> , why we use the then not , why we remember that we then things ?
maybe if you know the , or another this out in the internet , so , the human nature uses only 10 percent of the brain , buy you now this <unk> to , <unk> brain .
and <unk> there 's wrong , the a little .
ten percent , yes , maybe , but our brain is yes , in the course of our evolution , the pups , that was yes <unk> smaller , in the middle of us is still our <unk> with the inside , all other , <unk> educated .
that 's certainly not to happen because we do n't that we use .
why it seems to then , that we the top of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the term of the pun here ?
the i compared , in the , so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg see , in the ocean , is the top so the top , comes the ocean , down to come from a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , that are that 's about that , what our sense , our <unk> mind is , <unk> going , but , nine-tenths percent , it 's a giant <unk> go , <unk> .
we <unk> the point that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and to time <unk> on this memory back , maybe if you know the , or other people with <unk> memory .
people , suddenly , much more detail can remember when i do n't seen . i , in the situation <unk> , and the tell then <unk> , i ' said yes , but yes , but , where you know that ?
that 's , there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody the most on a field <unk> , the excellent treatment is , okay , so good <unk> memory , will was in a plane , he got , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow , not , over rome effectively went , which , rome to view , so rome is yes . ow , not necessarily the city , which , then , a giant of paper on and has started to rome to draw .
and that 's not somehow , so here , so the river , and there is , that , no , every home , every single door , and every window , once seen , so , <unk> , he was back to paper to .
how come from now that ?
so why can of that , why we ca n't that , well , the ; it 's may very close the <unk> bit more access on , nine-tenths of the craft .
now we use the yes , but why i can now , not , , <unk> the night , remember , in the details of ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to interesting about experiences .
he has even for example , you 've been working and has with a rape survivor who worked , had her experience is completely eliminated , that was n't even more mind , that <unk> <unk> the brain , that 's not happening , that 's way .
it , so that came the very good .
now i was there 's , but it , and <unk> to do .
there , they were in a very safe session , the end or after this event back , however , do n't even more active , remember it could , i could you then the hallmark of the car see , these people <unk> , that was not <unk> , that was under its feet , and .
and actually is with this hallmark of being on top , go .
the second what i very great found , was , he has a lady in <unk> had a , which has told me to your mother always embarrass her to alice in wonderland read , when she was little , four years .
there was they 're on the one lap , your mother and your mother has been reading .
and then , you said , in a trance , goes , but the time ago .
then , they started to read , she was four , that happens is , they could then still do n't read , today can you that .
and then you have said , he said , tell me , <unk> .
they have actually a copy of alice in wonderland found , where right on this side of text , and was , the lady i read .
the brain , so this side , so how she was <unk> , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so , we actually retained access , but we seem there in the normal life , we <unk> kind <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
, now that we yes , not that event , in fact , but how <unk> have said , he has been there 's a a a picture i saw , a , a <unk> , we can store , rather , our <unk> , so that , what we see , that , what we 'd smell , that , what we hear , that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you now <unk> , a yellow lemon , thinking and how they were there right <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> sense , like the taste , very popular example .
and , it was now <unk> long last night , put you , <unk> comfortably to , ha , <unk> bit above and , you can i ask you , close , but just a very short , your eyes .
and you remember , a very 're , positive that event in the recent past , yeah .
they take the first , what comes .
and , if you that now do , you might notice , to this memory of a visual part .
they get , maybe a picture , maybe a movie ?
some that falls that 's not only on , because we do n't that normal do , but that they make the first time .
and if you see that , it be , either in the movie are , from their eyes , all experience , like , see on a canvas .
that , we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they 're allowed the final thought back to solve , to the eyes peering back up .
who has because a visual information , the time hand up ?
yes , there , but <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's so , 'n third , i would say , yes , that 's about that , what i expected to have , it 's it 's actually something , what we so often do , it gives us in the first moment , not sure .
well , ' <unk> on .
<unk> what 's also is beautiful , , memories , if you memories <unk> , comes yes , not just this memory , up , <unk> <unk> feeling that , we <unk> a positive that event and i , in the , or other smiling can see , there was so , that was beautiful , there were , they laugh , and already is the memory that may still there , in fact that we do with memory , beautiful or other feelings .
and now comes out what 's exciting .
<unk> everything that was , well , the our brain power , the spot , no difference between what we actually remember , and the , what we just imagine , what we give me .
also that you can put yourself , if you to home <unk> down and , in the future to discuss that still not happening is , they are similar information , like something , if you , something i remember , in the past .
and , , you know , but certainly is these stories , you , so , in the situation round , of time .
then , hey , there is that happens , and that , and that was so beautiful , and ever more these stories behind , more beautiful , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people , a lot <unk> , there was the evening , a situation , there was the sunset , a lot of romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we mean , in stopping to do , so if we actually our memories so changing , why we doing this because not take action , i 'll ask you ?
<unk> , when i came down here , has to me my uncle is a picture that , of his hut , in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very beautiful shack .
just the picture is , <unk> bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic depiction of freedom , he told me explain , well , there 's the shack <unk> bit around , there is , 'n bit more of grass verge of , there 's a beautiful dog , before , the outside the sun , the alps , that 's quite a picture of the shack , not to fight .
and why we doing this because not with our own thoughts , our own external memories , hey , that bothers me , because , when i think that 's still more fun doing , what i there 's degree think ?
they have actually make a freedom , in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , yes , some people , you see the morning , if you just so this can have eyes , what 's because this ?
yes , i `` bad you 've made , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea of made me not more .
i think it 's around the he made the idea to do n't go .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he , germany , because his mother in <unk> stayed , and he has you just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he , every night with the son , down and has said , has been asking , so , what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , and tell time , and then , it to let , it <unk> let , it right to let , what today , great happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son was doing .
and then it was also , that the -- way is the coming , back to visit .
and the is today , that , the youth , done with the , is today , the <unk> people , i know .
it so these are not the memories , influence , the way we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on what it that we use .
and how much energy we started to get around , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , , that was today . ow , that 's so , <unk> that practice , i but really does n't , they make it 's and yet , like , you might tom cruise walk in this <unk> fiction film , this , this <unk> computer , where he shares his files <unk> <unk> , they do that , but also time , they looking for her image , <unk> have of this , well , not , so great a have to tell you , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , can the way to .
what ham , we because <unk> , still , ah , what 's nice , look over time , <unk> , that has to me <unk> ' real , like , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then take you but that time with .
they take that with in her <unk> and let you that work .
or if you know somebody <unk> 've , <unk> , was it <unk> their your boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , they will laugh <unk> .
so , take you also here that image , put you <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let you in the background horses jump , they laugh , why they will laugh ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of fun .
and you can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
can man memories so , ?
no , i think our brain has been so much greater capacity to think it 's all that can .
it makes but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we focus and how important , we make an event , a memory , a thought rate , it comes on us .
my plea , you , you , they play with the images in your head , they use the power of their own unconscious and they give him every day <unk> , their lives now .
yes , good afternoon .
thank you for the invitation .
if i on a party ever asked 'm going to what i 'm so in my spare time i do and tell , together with friends , <unk> <unk> and up , i see is shining eyes and in the head of my audience around the <unk> of those dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> up .
if i then <unk> , it , the film festival , a film festival , classical music is , say , ago , this dancing crowds of the old people , in now , long <unk> in <unk> of going to sit and very focused on the art , listening .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so similar to behave , that again , what we do .
so you yet a glimpse , which i 'll be talking , i put them a short film with them .
film .
there is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
that brings it 's my view , the right on the point .
since <unk> grow in the <unk> from the <unk> got out , something completely different .
we makers , are today , so forth between eighteen , and the middle of the end of two decades old , and have very early in our youth who experienced , which an enormous power and joy of us to classical music <unk> .
we have , but also have the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> us there some of joy , well , a little do .
and we are the physical belief that 's called the crisis the classical music ca n't , the content , so , the music , but at their <unk> is .
so we imagine the question , how do we have a <unk> create the music , the near the friends and this power back there , so , we so very , you like .
how do we have a <unk> organizing , that beyond the <unk> the <unk> work ?
we imagine the parameter , you go out of the classic concert will know , the room , light , context , basically in the question .
take , for the relationship between the audience , and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the audience a gap .
we 're trying to the pick .
here you a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians to sit in the audience , drink beer , entertain , in the breaks down with the audience gathers to stand on the play a , two pieces , put them , again in the audience .
the whole thing is the course at a little <unk> .
everybody , like it has <unk> , comes the stage , and .
or that sit in the concert .
in the classic concert , it 's so , you on more or less comfortable , permanent , chairs , so much like you here , and after the front of look , and listening .
but there 's music , you can not actually sit still .
and we thought i did , how can this model .
if you , sit and it a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , you are automatically lead differently .
still going to come , we in the concert does n't a stage had , but four stages the audience around .
the audience could , yes <unk> .
so i was , the night every once in the front row .
important for us is , we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music of thinking .
that we so , which spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the head of the people need the music , so , can see how they made to do ?
and so come up and then concerts by night , <unk> at 30 kilometers in <unk> , the s 's actually just of <unk> enlighten , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around , and the illumination can make music alive to let and now , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy , we 've been a few years , <unk> work together , with us the dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop a , not actually the dance . written .
and so come up and then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> from steve rich .
and in this year we 've got a , if you so i want to <unk> the task .
we first time to a concert together with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and that <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has , also why it works , because we have a big <unk> had , in this piece by the subject .
we have about a <unk> much money from people from , germany , back , so that we into the minds .
all this is this film festival , what from a community turned out of .
we 're totally happy in the ones , of <unk> in the town <unk> a home found .
the city is exactly that big , we great spaces and interesting places for actually find , but also , so small , we 'll notice .
if the beginning of the year in two weeks of <unk> from , europe in the city are , then drops on just , in the more people with <unk> around , usually .
the film festival , volunteering that .
we makers , are a all of students and students , and doctors , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really , totally up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> , that the <unk> or did , and funding in the eye you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , for a year so that task over .
it , volunteering , but they do , for a year 's why , for instance , that <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in a permanent hands are and to the film festival by going .
we do that all in our time , and life , germany .
that is , the part of labor of production and on a <unk> .
just three times , we meet us about the year is distributed to a city on weekends , we make , to talk about the , or other problems , up are , and governments and also the interpersonal together , that just <unk> 's important , if you , in the movement to keep you want .
the film festival , even come and then two decades until thirty thousand volunteers , the first to , a few days or a few weeks of their hands of being , touch , where the help it 's going to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in that 's 14 days to the musicians this .
now you could , so you have all of what you for a film festival , needs .
but our <unk> 's still on .
we find is in <unk> in the same as a great community , we built around , well , supported in the what we want to do .
that 's the classic <unk> go , and that 's but also about very practical things like , <unk> , we have a baker , of us with the bread <unk> or a <unk> , of us , fresh food to put it .
that <unk> going in a as the city there about the year alberto giacometti made and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole series of individuals who found , their living room to ask , with the musician , there is where we can .
and this and the way that 's film festival , something -- user-generated wisdom in this city has and the people in this city .
they identify , a very special kind of the way with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year , we were very much <unk> support of the citizens , place a <unk> into life out , now the entire endeavor , on a sustainable and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers , from the stage , that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly deeply happy about , in all of europe , young musicians played music in your hand , and home at , in the cities <unk> hold .
if you now , still not that really can imagine , that feels , classical music , to experience then they come , just over .
the next year , we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy , if you , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you may know that 's favor .
you heard that , learning or the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn about , a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> .
you know , with an experience of time <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i of art and culture that i 've , well , i can be a lot of course to say , because now . ar : am suggesting <unk> i mean , in this field .
and so i thought , maybe it really would , this is something <unk> title for a different <unk> still going to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , but much work .
they have now , this laughter .
you get always the laughter , though the most of the saying that you know .
why is that ?
i think , that has to do with , in the word to ask you something <unk> , what we 're not that really capture .
art , that we say , sometimes , that has what .
to work we say that often , that has what .
sometimes , too .
the people , like to work , that has what for me .
but at work , we think rather , <unk> and the art , rather , the rich , beyond the everyday , where we 're inside of us move , our experience to collect , our own thoughts .
and so i mean outcomes , i do you now , which i want , in about three hours in five into one of shared , all the headline have , with a i starts to make it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the childhood , is going on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , about and then on the word <unk> i 'm later , why i think that for my <unk> taken .
the interaction , for the first of my professional life and finally , five , positive identification .
intense of them will this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian stream .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn it that the first two , three years , if you were to practices , and i -- we practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little bits being played , the piano , not far from here , the <unk> , to home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there is a melody and played and the other voice <unk> , yet it 's very differently .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial , the art , it succeeds , and if it 's only two voices are , <unk> together , together to think , if that the present , the future , the past , is , works , images , in <unk> , in your plays , the things <unk> are , the moment to put together , that art makes me .
and i and learned , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , the <unk> <unk> , the same time to play , any kind but to hear , a to highlight , which does n't .
so that was , what i learned to have , under things .
a another experience , i 've never forget and i was the worry had to think it me today , maybe , you go to be .
i piano <unk> , it were still more people in the room , here today , and in the <unk> i came out .
i had it .
i brought her .
so again at the started and , the same , i 've got back to do n't on .
the audience has more and sweated , almost as i , because i went in all quiet on my place , i brought my notes , put you , and the third time the beginning .
and they do n't think the me <unk> have behind .
but that was a very heavy .
perhaps that was also a the experiences , where i then you know , well with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my spent , because , to tell you can be easier with cheating .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i mean , <unk> with the inspiration and also , i want to tell stories .
when i then so <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and she told him , rather , <unk> , i want to a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
there must you very many houses visited , and very much experience with women raised in .
now imagine you time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , a sentence .
the i sort of course not forget .
and , i sort of course , more adept .
now i was the way . '' and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember , a situation , i 'm so never more experienced .
it was that <unk> of dress of chopin , and now i 'm going to the part of work , i have a , just ca n't control , and she was with the most beautiful , , and you had the poor do , and then went to the back together and back apart .
i can it now unfortunately , not going on play , is not a piano , here , and i could it also .
i have this , two decades , over time i 'd have played and suddenly , you right .
and i then they keep playing and <unk> , i was in a feeling ecstasy and played , and i 'm not only still , i suddenly the quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had nothing we had to do n't have taken , and the music has that with me that .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really allow us .
and sometimes it 's also , for them to work , you in this had get , in this condition , i call it 's time , the <unk> .
where all of themselves involved .
we had this situation in fact , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost everything like of itself , as we the <unk> did , has the only two months taken , where you usually a half years , i 'd need .
so , that were my experiences with the piano , with the art , with an artistic quality work .
and now i 'm going to my student , <unk> .
i was first , even when musicians , along , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> played , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> , and have taught me , so it , next to my <unk> for the music and engage you can and that <unk> had .
in choir singing , together to breathe , a <unk> singing , wonderful experience , i was very , on , enlighten ourselves .
and then a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> , i 'm , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i do that 's why do with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there for me this idea , or this , this idea , from this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> also just in the <unk> have , politics and law a job .
because the art of culture to , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but just not as artists , but , otherwise would you , you do n't say <unk> , but rather than <unk> flow and on something to do .
i was there in the theater and have taught me <unk> , it was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , there , i did , and , i 've always more with this question is too , what you can do to art to the framework for art to her to a management , a good of the building ?
and that was the reason , why i actually , on 'm in my professional lives , , this <unk> , and with <unk> years , i mean , then <unk> .
but before that was a other <unk> , and this phase i mean , <unk> with the interaction .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has his <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because i in <unk> born was , always there is , the <unk> oliver <unk> , it 's `` pet peeves -- i , i have to the kind of time <unk> .
but i but a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
that was me before , something , what i 'm not so the chances of have , and suddenly i was sucked in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , who was of people in this in this <unk> device during the <unk> .
once the carnivale on us coming , were all in a very another situation , all other states .
and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague who was , we mix , for the <unk> night , music done , he had guitar , i piano , so , other has a bass -- played , for instance , i was visiting her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but of course , on the talk about the <unk> <unk> , for months practiced .
and this carnivale , that came really from the people out .
it was my destiny , the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't start with the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
have taught me , quickly come prepared to , on any questions , <unk> .
and go there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
so , i again , you have the interaction as those interactions of this is between two german cultures .
actually talk , the same language , the music is there , wonderful and was a wonderful played , but things that was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the carnivale it came not the people all of ourselves , but it was a lot of the top , and that i as a big gain it felt , here to see the german identity , that i later on time , back , slowly , very broken , and the german <unk> then these two states , connecting .
since is germany , yes <unk> .
since is also the federal much more <unk> placed .
interaction , i then , but , all things here that , and i know , in the food .
we have of the first place that i had the way , a <unk> , imagine if you time ago , when i 'm here , here we started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and spare time .
i have the still .
time for was <unk> , you ca n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was , which is the first of the <unk> .
so i was having not so much so , was that 's wonderful , this <unk> had , but they have disappeared , soon , because i then for education in charge , and to make alliances with the education do and make it could .
we have very much for the urban studies done , we have the if you only time , the analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what we there is that have the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between works and architecture to get you can , from <unk> , <unk> , the blue , it .
many , interactions , we were and i could make and i 've got the time , that means , if different people from different areas , a target to track .
you get the way , i always more <unk> of the art , more and the culture , which is , the scientific unifying between people , between cultures , between the communities , better , in the disapproving look , and i come , but afterwards the art .
interaction that was also then between the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea that had to the would be , january <unk> , that <unk> could , the <unk> europe that .
but this last chapter , this one fifth one chapter one has yet the headline of identification .
this word , yes , two primary meanings , one thing , , i either me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i can it , as verb , use and say , i either , that is , i know something .
and it 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i either you , or the or this community .
and i either me with something , when i 'm going to <unk> and say , that we 've been to me , i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action plan .
five billion point three million people to try to move , <unk> cities , identify the double the sense , to <unk> and to see , that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have it then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people , in a big farmland , and yet at least a common language to talk , <unk> nations are here and this was our key frontier , the positive identification to start with the people and of you course , too much the ride .
at the signs , <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience of the <unk> . i have not so many people around .
there , ham , <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , worked , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and young qatari students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have letters of people , young men , from <unk> to a play out of the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last four letters to have written .
and it was already a special effect , young girl letters of young <unk> up and boy , the russians and then the letters of young men from germany in something very visibly german .
and there sits down , of these young men , in the piano , and playing this <unk> , i so loved .
and , oh , who he made of a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him to home , as young german , he was , and i can never more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers , <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger , with a <unk> , sat down , again , in the piano in a play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it did n't show him .
it was for me , <unk> scene , after the drawing board off 'm , i said , what we actually learn ?
we learned , in the <unk> , many people together to move anything , but , all things we learned , we sixties , in <unk> in peace , and the culture that connects to do n't even more than the minds go , because we different languages to talk , we need to identify , us , inside of feeling .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's the can learn not just about , something to know .
it 's the learning , it , something to learn and <unk> to win .
and if we 're much up and invention of this happen , <unk> , if we let it , we inspire let of art and culture , our own right position to relate , in a dialog with the artwork , if we interact , also , our own identity , working , by , art and culture of them , let me , then we all have won
and i hope , they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where they are those profit .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture that .
so i have to <unk> to support my memory . here , a few slides <unk> .
it are , but no scientific slides , but it 's in my <unk> here 's why , a direction to find and me with a subject to grapple with , where i think , that 's going to us the next few years much about .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you that , what ted , i mean , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk quite arbitrary .
and then i still have heard , you the talk , in english , i think we should , if somehow became possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand , what i english , to say , i did n't know , right , i do it to say , and so i have the talk , then , but the german , left .
how we will die .
i have to them there first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , i the <unk> <unk> , and was 75 .
she was , nine-tenths of years old and has always like in the may , dance , because you that again , your husband is reminded , the first man , in war like it was then .
and so , it 's every year for the first of may , dance , and has a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot to finish , and then is being 75 and , , here on the right side , you see that , the leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years before was they also , even being 75 and i mean , the same way , with equal occasion , , even the left leg gets broken .
and i was also , there a physician and have experienced , weeks of the intensive , so , with the antibiotics that was treated , resurrects itself , and have the discussion around the way that was told , is because this sense ?
it makes all the sense , at a so old people like this intense , to use to stick ?
so this , to <unk> , the intensive care for weeks , that 's a people at all <unk> ?
and they then is fixed .
five years later i take the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the i can well it , because he just so rare is , indeed , the time that time , and , the dance in the may be back the other one leg gets broken .
so it , the question , what <unk> i actually , when i think about what i 'm speaking , like a human for instance , decide to , what he in his directives , or what he also , <unk> which ?
and that 's a topic that the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> the called the way we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to a report , the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization , very strong that was , so you ask , how can , where , connected to work ?
you , then , and that you can in this book also now , you read , just said , it is a quality of coming , so the always fit .
it is a sort of the work in front , it will also the work , a lot more you 're going to the example , after china , but that was a big issue .
and that 's actually , so come to basically the work of individual , so something to assemble , something to paint , always be less ending , that he always more control , of the quality , he delivers of the accuracy .
and that , after my prior assessment , the people who just always less of confidence from their work to the minds and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it was never about the height of <unk> to , and not more about , through his work , to define .
and if we now . to the <unk> and medical domain of , then there 's course , a development .
if you the tv , listen , what doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most not find them , you 're 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there must have documented , what you has done , so it <unk> 's going to make it even paid , and if not going to document is , says the health service that i also , care or this medical treatment for we do n't .
and through this feature documentary , but the work <unk> always more <unk> and more and is approaching this idea , you his work has and with the use of personal belief compound , the background , so a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a great friend of me is now , the netherlands , , because it do n't see here , i wanted to the had a <unk> , has the abandoned and this is after the netherlands , which to the doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are at these dynamics in most of a piece of forward and he , martin , had just experienced , more and old people swing between the nursing , the hospital , and back , because the <unk> not more you know , what they should do if it 's the people are worse .
then get the hospital , the house , you 've restored to go back into the senior home , or a nursing , and be there on those .
and this family had , that i thought , if it , structured them in holland , there , i want to be there 'd like to let me to stand here is something which actually , you , in the <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , in holland , got to he however , you see , after he the language with much trouble as i 've had learned , there 's exactly the same thing happens , what transpired in <unk> happened .
it will also the dying , a quality introduced .
it 's not more the credibility that matters , but you put even in an available , i want to the example , not be , or not the hospital , when i in a nursing home .
and then is that <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , the third of days , a conversation with the <unk> instead , and the need to then , an issue , i want to the hospital or i do n't want more into the hospital , when i do something happened .
well , with the , i want to be or i do n't want to be .
this data , then , a central and there is this physician , <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and it then the decision in the basis .
if we now , <unk> back , yes , like in the may , dance , and also , 75 was , and we imagine , have some point a design directives , , i want to do n't be brought them , you know , they this , for the dance in may , in the may , then again and headlong into this is , <unk> , more you can experience .
and that for my friend now , there in holland -- is , also very much <unk> , he lies with me to do .
in the last it 's so , <unk> today about their sixties , until seventy percent of people do n't even more to home to die , but in hospitals , that exist , and that these exist , also , so you do that sense , not the ideals of these are for the old people , but it 's often a closely , financially closely <unk> scope , the <unk> are often <unk> and the features for , and for instance , this <unk> find there , after my own perception , just limited .
there 's about it , who are the very good care about , there 's very <unk> people , there could use , but if i the <unk> at , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , and so it 's about five , six thousand , perhaps from <unk> to us <unk> , then i would for me say , it is hard , there , getting and be inside the self-esteem , unsustainable .
the entire course , has <unk> reasons , that 's very clear , this whole quality , those of it 's why , because the last the money for it 's not enough , all people can and in the way of those are and that the people , for good , or the medical performances that will be paid you to say , come , i well with , there , for instance , as caregivers have a family of feed , or two children .
that is today 's not just reality , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly it does it , just below .
this introduction of the quality , one time growing the market , you to adjust to , it , so , the top of individuals .
and now i 'm going to say , the maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the last , because i mean , first of questions asked , and leaves , very simple is the situation for affected .
so , i just time that <unk> <unk> and the article in one of me , there <unk> , because i think , a society , always so sophisticated structures , including the legal structure , we looked at the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> , one is that , would the people 's much untouchable stars .
and the second set up there is , you to protect is the top of task of <unk> .
and what i sometimes it 's missing , is still a third set in there , which every one , for instance , the commission we should , would to protect and to defend themselves .
because that 's a way is , to be free from this case , i do it 's another way , and the to me time somehow this comes and feed and then we need that i look at least not my thoughts about doing , i mean , even die .
because in the last , it is yes , so , we this subject does n't like to ask , we will eventually , the point to come .
hopefully it just too late , with hundreds or <unk> .
the equivalent of my career , to say that wish i each and there i want , , but some point is , this topic , to , and if it then maybe so far is , or also , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it can already late in life to be late in life be , to say , i 'm talking about this question now even think .
if you now think about , what i would come from , you on the results come , then the last out , what are because the five most important things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , quite en <unk> is .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends , i , i repeat , and when we can , i know , and the me through that live with her , it are the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between people , i may also related to have , in <unk> or in the actual visits , or a pastor or a <unk> or that other people , i in the relationship to earn .
and it there are very many of factors of course , there <unk> , i leave the right now , not all through .
but if you , these three penalty points , time at , then you have time a whole bunch of tasks , , in life there may possibly need to the last his own would to protect .
and then coming then , another factor of them to we have a dictatorship in the <unk> experience , i did this here , as a text , or as well , as an example of that .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , there <unk> , not meet .
that 's my inner conviction .
we would you can only one of us even come out .
so it 's not the question to be because others for me do , who 's going to me , providing the ability , or , for me use , who 's going on me to ?
but it 's exactly the other , to be asking where i can on people want , where you can i put myself and by my inner would to learn that i do with these questions to deal , and i was there position and around it can .
and if you then he says , how we 're going , so this inside this quality , , put it was , it 's a way , to say , how i me about my my inner , this mechanism .
because no man can tell me at the way i myself , because you see , and position .
and i must be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or out , say , you 've got now a design directives out and because you 've been so old , you , <unk> you , if you be brought to , if you on a intensive want .
these questions , i can in the only after a long <unk> probably <unk> frontier .
this would the people 's a inside of posture , in me is , and the not , that we can be the state , not can protect , also a law , not , i also other people <unk> can and me more <unk> , when i 'm doing that there themselves before , where we asked myself have to have , so the also know , what i for a person .
and to these conversations to lead , it takes just sealed spaces , and there , i think , and i put it this talk so called , and here , for , are these spaces like that <unk> in the food , that i put them here , both to go on a picture of time <unk> , spaces , where we 're talking about these subjects to think , where a more room is , so it does n't hurt , is that 's also may not to our theory is , but that even a conversation . there 's happening .
so we , if we then the old are , it can say , oh yeah , a dance in the may , despite my mind may very high ages , that would , what .
i thank you very much for listening .
beautiful good evening .
i do is two things with .
if you the first part to flat , is , you think you a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
that 's stupid , not , can take .
what my you ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is an infinitely big enough ?
yes !
that 's not good , if this one of it is , what 's nice .
well , in the fact , but i 'll it go , for the , you know it .
that 's exactly how we do n't .
we have about us with just one .
and i frontier that would like a little go to a finite planet .
<unk> , finite , we know , which form , we need to know .
and it 's for the <unk> to the magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite along these are , and the two <unk> , in the an example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , , now , we look in the box in the number is small , it are three : chairs and it are three people .
we can we 're checking the votes in each of the same amount of elements in there is ?
they count , we do it ?
that is , we would just the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three : chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that my you , yeah ?
very good .
that works in a finite wonderful , that 's also at large numbers , though it can level-up .
but it does .
how do you want to count ?
how can still going to check , so many people like the chairs out there are ?
i 'm aware of the chairs and people were taken and not what else .
<unk> .
you 're called the couples .
you very well , that that is , not , we 're now the ground along , and understand that , all .
not , that 's very good .
so , you that 's called , too advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , , you on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> the way , the next <unk> , everything is so , different people get different chairs , not a chair that empty and the amount of these are the same size , okay .
now we go into the infinity .
how do we have two large infinite amount of each other than that ?
we would say , a is that big or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we do it ?
we 'd go back to .
alright , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite long reams of start to count , i would time just say , they do n't come to the other .
<unk> , forever , is , <unk> ?
so , how about it ?
madame ?
no way , madame !
they had that , but that really started .
they mate .
so , now we look at the time .
estimate , estimate is in an always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is what , you do it .
if i said , for the <unk> take the natural numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need the zero in the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have to say , , a copy of this <unk> and take from one of the infinite , you <unk> numbers .
left to the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are <unk> the infinite number of a long , the natural numbers , but the a band of the <unk> , the other people are the line , and the <unk> on , okay .
we call the a lot , g , straight to pay , we call the other sorts of n , the natural numbers .
what you think ?
this is , g , more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same size or smaller ?
the same size ?
but that 's very now , yes , a missing , the <unk> .
who 's a different estimate . '' ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , has yes , really do n't plan , yeah ?
that can yes , not be , yeah ?
you can yes , not , where what 's missing , bigger , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you would assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , what you also suspected , course , is wrong .
and now , and now i 'm explaining why the full of them are alike .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two come from two , after the zero to come from the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , six , the three , eight , four , yeah ?
you can that 's also turn , it doubled , that is , <unk> ?
and completely clear that is , by the <unk> do it , that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and here 's one , there are just the straight on the band is the same for , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural on the straight , <unk> , the <unk> are way , and the band is still in a long .
that 's just in an .
so if you any chance to explain what we have today i learned to have the infinity learned , yes , what 's because it , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property , there 's in a finite just not and this is , is an absolute <unk> , a real subset of the right that big .
do that you in a finite not , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , it 's only still a great , and before they were 's three .
yes , so we go .
it 's none of links ?
okay .
then do we still a second part of the odds .
the professionals , a three-hour meeting the odds .
i did here what brought .
at this experiment , i 'm sure , it at least a third , and <unk> it does anybody with , that it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a boca , b , c .
i 've got behind anything hidden , i hope , you , it ai n't heard .
and they should now we 'll just guess .
where , my you , i have something hidden , behind a boca , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate the c .
who has , another idea ?
a ?
who still has an idea ?
i 'm going to <unk> , b has been missing , not , you 'll hear the yes , never giving the <unk> ?
so this is right .
it 's really completely different matter , so they have to do n't mean , the three of letters to fall and i 'm looking for me a .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because the chance , they 're lucky to have , is yes , they only in a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i just a on .
well , i of course , where it 's .
<unk> , that , here somebody , <unk> .
so , i know , where it 's , and that i guess , and appreciate that , or how do anything that you do it 's called , is in a second round .
so i 'm now really the game to think i now it now , <unk> .
so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now , , i <unk> me on this a , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show up behind the n't it 's and the they do n't have said .
because , if you now , b to say , and i say , and i know , it is yes , not the b .
then there 's yes , not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , luck had .
but i must , that 's <unk> , in the second round go .
so i can just a wide open , behind the 's not only is , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is the three-hour meeting the odds , under the one here has remained , under the condition , b is open is , and it 's not that is , you have now your last chance , to guess .
they 're allowed now , a to stay , then i do necessarily a , on .
i do now that on , what they want .
or they say , i do , c .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this know more likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , god was very much , b is open been is , i always wanted , a to stay , this is it .
or you now say , but that 's <unk> , we have , <unk> the way , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what my you ?
it 's not matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very good .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , yes , that 's wrong .
that does mean , almost , as if we do it yesterday <unk> have , <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , this , the thing is very <unk> , yeah .
understand that all sorts between , i 'm not , six and yeah , i ca n't sixties years , you can i 'll do n't even more part , <unk> ?
so , it . '' the really everybody .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third of the way of the door .
you can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds are you in the dirt .
that is , they can on two doors to guess , not , that , yes , at <unk> do , you ca : yes , two dozen put them , you 're it , <unk> , the zero time i transferred to that 's yes , everything in real life .
but here we just a door .
so , now is this , two thirds of it 's not , guess .
so what 's the two thirds of here , but it can help but just behind a door to be .
behind the news is it 's not .
so , then is likely ?
no way , i really have it 's hidden away .
so , what is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's just , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they have any luck had .
why ?
very simple , two thirds of these are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was for every what that .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , here , of bad diet and bad food and overweight people coming , that depressed , yes , completely .
but i whistle , in my best , that after all over again , this is , some insights .
i come , which of <unk> farm and i knew i went to 12 signature was actually do n't a mcdonald 's .
that time , who , yes .
yeah .
thank you for the references some today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't know , mr. <unk> , so on it came to me to be asking whether i the ted , the seas as i want , and about a subject to talk .
i told me <unk> <unk> : the issue .
now , motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , the has said , maybe the power of a or another , later , sports .
if only i also full of that .
so today at night at the rain , jogging to be now <unk> a tall order , but i have to the morning in the fact , training , because i in three weeks , <unk> june , <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to go to deal with <unk> bike ride -- that are <unk> miles .
go to me that tomorrow makes the rain . not <unk> .
so who ride to <unk> , about this morning , early on , in <unk> , i post , they all welcome .
i ' been already said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue .
and i ' i started in the extra , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , the blind faith , come up afterwards <unk> .
i , before me just thought about it did , when i <unk> 'm like to describe what i the right place where i <unk> ?
so , i come from <unk> village with six houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and at my parents to the farm there 's one apple , <unk> and <unk> -- and what makes you from <unk> , beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in <unk> but at me , <unk> and beer .
why would tell , i the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is a the very important stories , i really , right from the country , from village , come , and there up , i 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> is .
and with the second half brother , the same way we think there 's like i .
it means , you see light and dark , you can see how i just might also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it light , is , or from .
what today , it 's for the <unk> .
the , we both can just see , if ago , we do anything .
'n cart , but i say , , i can do n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> cart .
the of the the old men , <unk> .
always to go <unk> .
and what for me , but always , was critical , is course , the fact , written by you trust and you 'll just this big trust , that <unk> , we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , say , i time .
and the was for my parents definitely , how many of them , ago , my brother and i still not even blind people knew .
we were so the first , then is a sudden in their lives <unk> .
and then they had from the situation of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant lucky , my parents than farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and us , the hand to move or to say , there 's <unk> wall , <unk> you time , along and you can , then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning of us to have encouraged , always get to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone <unk> , the <unk> down and <unk> , it also time to risk .
there has the blind brother and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> mean by , <unk> followers .
the order to the order to i have to today still .
so this is that with the big brothers -- the 're not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brothers and and my brothers and i we ham the <unk> courtyard , really that all the outside did , ma , that i could do , all , for bicycle , drive .
and that has the <unk> brother , with the desire that we started with three years , and then we wanted to say , also -- michael and i .
and have then started , with <unk> to go down , how to many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that , i started with <unk> , without .
and then is the big question : how to be an ma , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one that trust the parents , the children , eventually brought back from the bicycle <unk> and <unk> and other thing that trust of us , we 're not permanently , where it can drive .
and our solution was , we course , a , from our parents tell us have let , where are the <unk> , so where there is a car , where <unk> followers , where are you may also time on an unfamiliar , things , homes -- the turns out you now , not the way -- there , we did , so they are .
and we had in choosing to us that one remember , but the other hand , listen .
and that you can now , in here , not all the test , because you will it here so loud , they do n't actually more of them .
but <unk> , evening when , it light up and , in their bedrooms , or in whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
you can time trying to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , choosing , and they 're going , is at us people just like , bats are also -- they 're going to a resistance .
so how the bats , so with <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound that different <unk> will .
and that 's for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , always very important .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the safety , i ' <unk> chance , there <unk> piece to help .
and i just to believe is no big trouble and now , you also , many accidents , the , or other , there 's the course , .
what i unfortunately , no pictures , i did , that i very <unk> itself is , our <unk> , as children .
which is from climb on our higher building on <unk> farm .
i , here is written , the confidence , it also by a <unk> diversity .
and that my goodness ' i 've been very literally , because i was a man , the , much , later in <unk> and in the <unk> with the trust the scientific side of busy . i , i 'm about one thing , never yes , or i 've never that stumbled upon how i do it themselves have .
i did , in the never been so that may also gotten dramatically read .
but it has certainly is also to do with that , of course not everybody so , experimentally to get you can .
the diversity is the figure out of our strengths with that are announcing to some point to know , where i a good , what i talent and where i can just my strengths really also full <unk> ?
and our brother , again , the , michael and i 've always took on the roofs off the house .
so , then , okay , we ham , here 's a <unk> .
there you reach anywhere from <unk> window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the johannes was then right away , michael afterwards , and i , probably already , i still <unk> little bit like the girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i 'm not .
but the end , who stays like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think , in the others , we 're yes , the next generation of young women , here , also not .
and of so i 'm , then , always with .
and then was , the consequence , we operate at all three <unk> <unk> up and the dad with <unk> used with <unk> <unk> <unk> and do n't even more you know , what he now , to say .
because of trust is sort of course , then , when others are scared .
have the father so , to god 's sake , help to help to help , if only , in the risk of relative size been , that one of us , too afraid she had and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i 'm not -- somehow <unk> would be .
it is , but never happened .
he had , mix , so <unk> , he told us that i also again , <unk> , or by johannes <unk> , of us , then returned .
and that was , i for me very great , we these opportunities .
but now , you do n't worry , that 's no value proposition , not necessary to later <unk> to do .
for me , the different kinds of sports , in my life has always important were , all , interesting .
and , they were all for <unk> , because i just said , i could see , where i ' , i mean , borders , what are perhaps , so my gifts .
so to <unk> good <unk> i 've never can be .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , until now not like in <unk> .
i go , until today rather out in the rain .
now , not at five degrees , like the moment .
and at <unk> rain , but nevertheless , rather than the inside them .
but i , always for me so that trust in my strengths with being discovered , in terms of sports one . i .
as the first example , <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , of us in <unk> had , has said , ok , we have it louder <unk> children , but they send ' us <unk> couple of the blind children .
actually about it , yeah well , because there you pack , anyway , they 're on the coats .
and then you notice , what the other people power .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , when i the competition for taking place 'm going 's hard , because then you can the others may yet , what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a way , and this is the faith in my initial speed .
the other into a foot in the <unk> imagine , i find ourselves backwards , let it fall , the <unk> head . '' and then is he back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score , there .
i 'll let 's here 's not for yourself .
i had it i thought , but <unk> .
i think , that 's now <unk> bit risky .
and that i also now here 's not have volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
crap , i <unk> ' .
okay .
the next for me that was a sport during the school , then the <unk> and that <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that you have to we also have taught me as children .
but for me was always in the school , i realized that important : how can i as much , after the school to move to my excess energy to get that ?
so , i then a way in the school <unk> to do .
and although i actually always thought , that 's all so , <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> more , <unk> ' i .
i found , i used -- <unk> ' i am today .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i did , then , in the first time , man , again , is the great diversity here in the sport , because you condition , needs , you need power , ai n't good did , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- they have probably a lot also of their work recognized ?
exactly that 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you that all of faith in the your technology has .
if you that trust in the own power has -- so the power , you the way that i also , then , every other conditions , the bad weather , the soft snow , the <unk> snow , the skiing , can .
and if you in my case that i also have faith in the team has .
because when <unk> , nothing like , i mean , wheelchair-bound <unk> <unk> .
and me is still never have that <unk> happens like today -- i have to the word to use -- my <unk> -- there 's `` yes , just a -- has already today , my exercise .
so , but nothing , we do you yet again .
specifically , i <unk> 's and you now maybe just time .
do with a , a , of them later , other exercise .
what i find is always do the subject of the blind faith , is the exercise , the listener , just imagine making myself how it 's so , if you ca n't see that <unk> to make and with its <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> yes , you has two sticks in the hand .
of so , , i did , i was no one hand , more free , else could i mean , my goodness ' <unk> take and myself the <unk> feel them .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my <unk> , the ago me .
and the explain me with the voice , the way .
so the to just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision somewhere in the communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> says , just showed me , <unk> , if it <unk> about , says , i <unk> and <unk> , the says , then , left on the 11 , i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of <unk> at with the pointer .
when he says , left on top 10 little sharper left , and when he says , right on top 10 .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to again , folks , or he had to me again , again , i know , , now is what do n't .
and for me is yes , the very big , which is , if the <unk> ago i 'm going , i have to the really completely <unk> to 's time , negative to say .
to 's positive way to say , he 's for me that tool , that 's me to , just really , then quickly to be and in <unk> , faster than others , in the competition to start .
and that i can only , when i am i just do , with both the poor me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg anchored to stand and i must now really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or they can also open , let , to `` yes .
and must then , so <unk> and must then on the other one leg and the same way back to stand and you can not here <unk> bit of balance , but to actually as being quiet .
also with high shoes .
yes , and that 's for me that very crucial , when i the <unk> 'm just imagine : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i say a guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had to , how do it , just to say , hey , you 've got me the right <unk> do , because the , the see , yes .
the know , not , what he told me to say .
so i 'm one , the him the way for communications , open to .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know , he can i mean , i do n't help , but there i just wondered , and to say : well , i need , in terms of you the rate , maybe <unk> <unk> used <unk> .
or i need , in terms of you like now , walking , you just showed me also time she says , how long , in the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> o.s , you think , some time : now , it must , but over to be .
and of again in , like nuts and that thing you just not on .
and there practice , i then , also time the pilot , how it 's the walking is , on <unk> <unk> forward , i then he says , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes left behind us , we may -- so we ham the other time <unk> minutes , it -- then we 're it , but again , i 'd <unk> .
of why is that for me , very important , there 's also the exact figures , weirdly <unk> .
i 'm listening `` <unk> -- here 's probably another , also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who is more ?
so my best thing was time , time , but that was in september , and now , in april , may i 's honest , i said , never been so much faster , did not like thirty-six minute .
and the uncanny the moment , <unk> .
and for me , again , it 's that <unk> <unk> only then as possible , when i just mean ears , frankly i did .
the other just showed me , exactly explain , what he comes to , like , and i 'm so the possibility that there , my risk , perfectly to estimate .
and that 's for me , the very important stuff , why i say , trust is more of training and not this <unk> <unk> .
so , ' paste them as a blind now not so much , i said -- from <unk> .
because i also , that experience we had to me a <unk> right , and the wrong <unk> had .
and then was in the competition , bad , because it 's next to the way , three feet <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- again , but that was -- of course <unk> on .
that i also , because the <unk> to , yes , turn , to so <unk> <unk> .
and i think about it happening today still be permanently , i got people say , left and say , then , <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
it makes the ground , not so much .
but , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , like that if it 's time quickly go to .
then is , precision , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , again , it 's called the blind faith that , that i the risks that you know .
so , i must be honest , i am when someone , not see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> , in my risk in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now , quite all .
the driving <unk> tree , from falling slope , down <unk> , i know , and i <unk> , but of course -- and that is yes , that important -- i <unk> , also the good news sites .
the which then also , can be able to the trust that there is .
and if you know somebody has found , just really want a hundred percent , so <unk> , i am i just need .
and , i , also have the goals . i .
because that 's for me in the subject of trust that the next thing very crucial .
you need the goal and i have to just really also clear to be , which means , really , trust and also gives us ?
because of this is often <unk> faster term , you time .
i trust , or the or i do .
but the very key is yes , that it , too much on .
that you for that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you yes , -- because we people all with <unk> <unk> got to meet -- we want <unk> that sense .
and the sense , is very often , we just might also create , 'n goal together to achieve .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- of some , weeks . i ' i am i the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i right , i have to me now , for , or the i put in the case that trust you can , i just this mountain , up to get .
and how do you , then , you the bell mountain , some really up there 's right ?
well , i mean , the giant advantage , i , some things now we did n't see , if it for instance , next to me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relatively unknown .
can <unk> be an advantage , is heights , which is no problem .
and i , that , the wooded heights that worked , now , regardless of the <unk> i go and to time , i did , i then did something <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew , there will you with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that 's already <unk> bit <unk> , then up there is , and down the cars can hear , then you still not a lot to see , there to know , now , do it hurts , when i <unk> .
and these things are for me , always been quite interesting .
now , you to also the <unk> to have , but to just also to know , hey , i war , in the key to , when i think there 's so yes , focus , <unk> and you can just by but also got a new new experience .
and that 's exactly <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes , you about every day , 10 hours ago , and it 's some of just still get
you about and it is , and has only still rocks to , around , always , plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun of years ago <unk> first world war , has .
so if you <unk> <unk> see , is the <unk> about the last the <unk> .
the only then so that the only an exciting .
we have the <unk> just from the distance ever seen or the other way that .
of so <unk> ' i doing <unk> a faith in the <unk> -- despite his silly <unk> , he and i had .
because i thought i ' : well , so , like i said , there <unk> ' i probably going faster , how to the thing actually has .
but , it 's otherwise be pretty <unk> , because you , to <unk> actually now that 's not really much change .
and really exciting is that 's and then , yes , something hard .
so if you then in the go over and the air thinner .
or if it 's the next to a off , then <unk> little <unk> , where it 's left and right off .
then is a 's particularly beautiful and if it , still accounting night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , then at us the <unk> , sometimes , specifically , now he would i 'd come to the wire , here , so he then i was also really in at the grip .
because i the only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to be .
trust , we know it was created , i just said i did : well , i can course , she , my friend , and it was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> , you and we have that before well <unk> .
but i need , also <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently , focus to , because , you can imagine , if you the bell mountain time and he says <unk> stone , right , right on one , left on the 11 .
there will eventually you <unk> , and it all .
so for us is faith in the case been , we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a rope , your backpack goes to them , that i had in the hand , and i 'm then behind her , the cool <unk> rope has gone .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> , i also with <unk> bit , the the stairs i realized i did .
and you is then eventually , only still , with the foot <unk> stone had or , with her <unk> <unk> rock on , i just might also have already know , so on me ask , and i 'm not permanently , just focus had .
and what i looked at the way that i really has shown , how beautiful it 's actually , of course , then eventually , there the top of approaching , you just this is really so again in consistency , has -- just like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
other thing is it , so , i realized i did , that trust , in me . i , that is , those who just , now if i really <unk> goal . i , like that the top .
but that trust is also in other , the <unk> , like trust , just work .
when we then at night , the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , mostly , in front and behind us are the other seven participants did and the were always is reasonably close behind us and it has to everyone can pause it was a different from behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why do , because why , looking , because , everybody , it there behind us can run ?
at night , you can also the girls not back of that .
that 's kind not the apparently .
and then i did , i eventually the time , oh yeah , ok , of their faith in their skills is an also some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the dark , you go to 12 years at go , then you 'll no light .
that 's totally geriatrics , if you <unk> is the air , skinny , so really only still where geriatrics and now , not more <unk> first place .
and then coming , but eventually , the moment where the , have said : yeah , man , that was actually , practical , behind you to go , because the friend of me has just showed me all explains , we 've always <unk> -- like that women , so do .
have all the night of us anything , and the other in the group , right there that , the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now just <unk> hour , that she have to me then told .
or i quit her what 's very different now not from a story .
and that 's exactly to know , it 's still , there , it may also just bad about <unk> about perhaps we had time talking about -- it are only still <unk> hour , the sun 's going on .
so , these things , also have this open-heartedness , can trust , again , significantly increase and you can just that are going to you so the personal medal but just also done .
and it 's for me faith , then , and this is , then the perfect , if you just so the personal medal and that , just really do n't want , then eventually , in the idea of the right there is .
that 's kind of course , in in sports , with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- i actually also not , why that 's go to make -- maybe , i 'm not the value to test , or to look , whether it , just to lead , very is ?
so i think , at some medals that it 's so , in vancouver in the were six grams a hard .
if all that 's a gold would , <unk> i 'm not here , i would have the <unk> , which i .
or at least in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but , i think , in the real , why you that power , is more importantly , you can imagine : what i did , i actually been created and how i mean , skills and forces are focused on a point .
how i did , i in me in my skills , but of course , in his team , that we all need to matter , whether in studying , in the job in which one thing .
no matter if the old man or young woman , we need that people , in the we trust .
and if we then this goal in the head clear , have eyes and that again , have , is that the best evidence , we look at least in a project in our lives of trust the minds .
and if you have it once you can , you can 's also , definitely increase in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , is the title of my talk , that is after <unk> your nice maps .
what i 'm driving , is the very <unk> effort , the science , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
, really taken seawater could i 'm pleased to be .
if i said , as <unk> , there 's all <unk> only with the literature to science , the <unk> <unk> is .
even though every <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where science , <unk> , somehow an act of a whole .
every station has at least a <unk> , where i kind of scientific dispute about social processes .
in fact , that 's totally <unk> , if you look , what it , magazines and <unk> for children there with science data subjects .
every program has somehow , a own off in <unk> , but still is that a pure <unk> story .
science is a thing , can i 'd like at the can do n't i read , but that that 's me , not even .
cool , it 's science just kind , at csi to , `` breaking <unk> , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
at csi so a <unk> five minutes , you do anything with the reality to do , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , i can tell me to identify .
big bang theory , i can get into laughter , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's great .
that 's extremely too .
because , that 's kind of a paradox , the future will we just manage honeybee hives can with these technological issues and issues .
but at bay area that none , to itself .
i 've got a few little examples of time i 've , like science , or science , just at us that in a given to have .
well , <unk> , in london , you have a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , time , not so now , we build the time somehow being so <unk> .
what happens is , right now , the sun of up in this facade , falls , i think that time provisional well , really focused on and then , somewhere in other <unk> , the centre .
that was the size by the press , stood there , just a jaguar .
too , the heat , so you know , this poor <unk> , really long , long to go , there are the <unk> time .
there she asks you , so a top-ranking architect , has the n't actually somehow , a bit of what in physics that , because i mean , is yes , completely new , so a mirror that stuff is focused .
so , what i found , new , is <unk> , sort of & before christ , where he was supposedly , are a fleet of an innocent mind .
there question i really , what has the more design or an architect , or where he has studied ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is given such current to have , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , that 's now , a few years ago , as that does not just sort of the media came .
there was the train has sailed , because <unk> changed the plants , that was on once a danger .
the gene was the gas , with green <unk> .
genes that were kind of what we first .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's all situations , where the market , really become have : hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea , that we want to , yeah .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get into discussing .
but to the time i was in the lab , active in and was eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried to these evil genes in my bacteria <unk> , this <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came home to , and i was my neighbor , 'd , you see , but not happy , what 's because this ?
i 'm so , yes , i try there 's been three days , a little gene in my bacteria to transform and that 's all .
so that was , what i 've tried to to explain so somehow a <unk> , gene , i thought , yes , the good old lady , when i of genes are talking to know , , she .
so that was , what i actually meant , so one particular sequence , i there in this <unk> <unk> i wanted to .
but that was what the woman in the subject .
this woman , i 'm never again , the hand , all shook up !
who knows , what i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very bad .
now that 's already well , 10 years ago , and yet , that kind of the minds of the ones .
genes , that there 's what we first .
<unk> i quite a long did n't even more to read .
it is , in , technology for free and it , but really in our language , there 's thought .
<unk> to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different , a lot of the maize , yes , does not genes that contains .
a different headline writers , <unk> , rats to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
the but we 're not so old and it 's also is no matter , which the level that i 'd be ways .
no matter , whether the time , or the picture , all about a lot of <unk> .
fortunately , it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , that 's it also not more time .
but the simple , which insecurity in the population but there , because they simply not with the themes of .
nevertheless , we 're in our future us with these technologies are .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the size of the issue , but it be about things to and one what the most really no idea .
and that 's pretty sad .
how come , all this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this small , boy , this motivated the scientists are sitting in his lab , has a little experiment , interactions like anything , beautiful and well , and he does n't think , man , that is , but the time , what , that interested , but the public .
then to that , the professor go .
the head , decides then , okay , very cool topic , down into his name on as <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> be .
good idea , i still not in the public , it 's , a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh , great idea , there we make a press <unk> .
<unk> , we have a press , with a project , a fabulous idea , and that 's coming then sort of out of ivory coast .
that is then <unk> , yes , but , who really ?
now are these institute rarely go alone , usually have multiple <unk> so a common of the design , a common <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> , really cool projects , then the <unk> , the magazine , , the editors , no matter whether it took leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
from the it will always on to be filtered , in ivory up until the really , really cool experiments , then , really to speak of projects , there in this <unk> up .
that are the single on a magazine , are really well done , there 's of all there 's free , yes , but who get i do with ?
, took only the , for interest .
in the <unk> we call that 's always the <unk> the <unk> .
so the , anyway , that interested in the <unk> then , the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
as a magazine , the audience , the , for interest , maybe about a have , where <unk> it 's even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i , but really ?
the <unk> , it anyway .
the way , that was now , the otto citizen , i call him a gentleman <unk> <unk> , under the circumstances , the publications i read , i tried , it , unbiased , to keep , i get i 'm going to do n't really .
yet , again , our future will we just sort of coming , if we do with these <unk> are .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all , the <unk> are the gentleman <unk> but not really understand and and the he sort of voting to .
my project , my idea is therefore , different to scale-up , these little , young , you get a scientist out of ivory to take , really completely of its regular <unk> to separate , and he 's a course , to do , a seminar , science , which communicates .
what is usually happens to a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know , we 've been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at us a unwritten rule , it 's not after his job to ask .
as he the mouth does and about his career telling , so , we <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists , tell then , what of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds , chemical reactivity , <unk> , chemically is , almost like that same level like the genes .
reactivity , treated , that 's kind , oh , you ca n't know , behind .
the really teach them to pass time on , that 's beautiful and well , if you a conference on you and there your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want , then you 'd like of <unk> tell , but the bleeding , to say , just water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , that 's my idea , these young scientist , still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , still a little more malleable are the school i , an argument .
that has for all of a use , <unk> , always , unsophisticated investors , to also know , there in the <unk> happens .
eventually , are also by over the there be used , so the need to , actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want you , really , a jury , and the to your project to your project a jury , very tough to guide , straightforwardly , worse , let 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know , if that is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , then you do it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really need to rethink the way to really quite normal , an communicate ?
so , there 's already several .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in , everyone at the current day , but there also get i , took only , again <unk> .
who <unk> because , <unk> the city in the university , some morning , then , there a talk to <unk> times . '' ?
these are the , it anyway .
there , i went back to my <unk> .
so , are the people , anyway , for interest , there , drive and , there , one talks , listen .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy , driving home to and that 's it .
so i 'm still on a second aspect to say , it stays not in <unk> the project .
these scientists are also , trained , wired , actually children ?
because many really <unk> have , on the essential to .
because scientists , like the research , and how children in their world to explore , is identical .
kids who work , extremely scientifically .
they do anything that learning the walk .
they try to what , it work ?
<unk> , fall , the way to do n't work , next to repetition , i change a parameter , i do it , new .
children learn from extremely scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i change to tell , it works or not .
that 's normal .
but that have many <unk> .
and of so i think , really can work that just the day after the <unk> , and these scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids of kindergarten , from the school , there in life experiments to the children , on their <unk> , and , there really to engage , because i 'm convinced i 'm going to the children and the scientists are actually , i took the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , that 's my hope to tell the kids that , at home , and then i get i also a gentleman <unk> , the , then , even for scientific data subjects were interested , because the children with him that tell .
that 's then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children to tell him , that it <unk> mirror , <unk> worked , that it , your bread <unk> has to think it 's paper lit , and understand , and shaking , then you may also the head , like an architect , build a house .
and not just get i then , mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
that 's my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it 's now , like , that the first <unk> , i 'd have to have said , yes , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that that 's just not subject , have just other priorities .
a scientist to yes , not to communicate .
yes , i told me then , okay , then she calls i the next sentence .
but who somehow , at work , <unk> is in a company , always , there 's in the next break .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the last few weeks were terrible .
the weather , we have a big is through the calculation .
ago , seven , soon after eight years i 've been asked , if i 'm here that and they want .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite far to go up for .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me was that actually more , yeah , that 's but <unk> .
what is that really ?
<unk> , that 's actually a ridiculous .
i then , but you know that , who 's behind it 's and it 's why i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it is , also , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next <unk> , eighteen minutes a little bit of this life of <unk> tell .
i 'm the ceo in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or hit eighteen years .
the know what the zeppelin and here at <unk> .
zeppelin .
that a picture , that i do you here show you want to the little one point , right , that 's really that a red , a <unk> on , or anything to do n't know , yes , this is still going to the size .
there 's because the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and of these are actually just now , 10 to action .
the life , what .
there 's about 20 thousand active because the world <unk> .
so that 's actually not like a market .
that 's also do n't a niche interest .
that 's a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why the then actually ?
how is this ?
<unk> in which was and only 10 to action , we do afterwards , this talk about why that 's .
very short , the history .
<unk> has a of you crazy <unk> <unk> the little bit here 's started .
very short quick .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war around eighteen <unk> into life launched .
then they were in the first world war , <unk> zeppelin and died of the way <unk> and <unk> , been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the have then in london bombarded by and so , and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight to london got these are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , were the newspapers <unk> with the headline said , this time you come , but not with atomic bombs , but in to intent .
so that has the story in there <unk> .
and we had a 'm a campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so very pleased to because he suddenly realized that 's become , there , behind it was in the old memory in there 'd put them .
and well , that was , for the marketing -- a critical .
but yet it was in london a good dress campaign , except the weather in north end up there was , many years , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much for flying .
then , <unk> two decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> that , taken .
and has a <unk> for maybe , that then to america and delivered the house .
that has a myth , where , that the german nation of , again something felt that has , which <unk> and <unk> that airship has been .
there was the then , in new york receive up with a ticker tape .
and the german nation 's got out , <unk> , we are again , who .
that 's in all know that inside and that 's really that explains a little that myth is from this device .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven <unk> even still were built and really only two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and the hindenburg was the passengers promoted .
passengers , a hundred , where around <unk> passengers , and <unk> were it in the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then there was the first broadcast live , these are the crash , there , unfortunately , yes <unk> .
next to the titanic that event that time , where a an icon , a product <unk> is , and then also never more and then in flight .
also the other , were being biased .
and <unk> , <unk> the past , no <unk> destroyed .
the the materials are used for <unk> , <unk> , the halls ground .
and then i was for nothing about their sixties years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin , had the idea , perhaps , that back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because you , technically a great product has evolved to come we 'll get here , but the market .
yes , he 's even a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , that is perhaps , just to explain , we ham , in time it 's still , <unk> , people who has a lot did .
there 's many companies , the question , corporation that are .
it are today <unk> , about 20 billion of revenue .
that 's a real entails , the profitable .
there 's a lot of it .
the have to me , convinced , here come to come .
the zeppelin , is actually a very normal power plane , how each other infinite plane , but , sorry , very a gas , the helium 's not evolve hydrogen , and very , a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , in the water on and under up , and there the <unk> to alert .
the time now is not there , that in the details to understand .
it looks a zeppelin and so , with a structure .
there 's two varieties of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have it 's no structure and the are basically like a balloon , in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , the world has built been are , about four , a kilometer .
and of it 's only today , i said , only still <unk> in which was minus to our own was , so around the only still two decades .
so you see then the production , if a shell where will .
the left the structure .
and the shell is also <unk> .
it comes from the <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
it 's one point two million dollars , so a shell .
and this is to <unk> be , to <unk> , and also has to <unk> be , because , you have to yes , look , if , crack in it would or a hole , that 's not on to shreds .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> do and look , whether it 's going on the black holes in control .
and the end looks a flying airship on without the grow , it 's there .
the zeppelin -- is so technically a <unk> product .
and that you look down here , the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six times four percent <unk> , that means of a thousand flights , about falling , maybe <unk> .
that 's very little bit and very good .
that 's a <unk> .
the can you see .
but there 's a other trend , of us at about power and the have i ended up here 's mapped .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started ago , <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were in their sixties percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> it , something that wants , then you can say at least in these eight years , of course , an the <unk> , also , in these eight years , the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can be there passengers , not by a fog .
the want , yes , something .
and the <unk> or <unk> up , every year , has been .
so a picture of the fact that our weather , not just felt , but also , statistically , because we do the weather , every day , to change .
but because that 's so , that 's now that well , has the a program being remade <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come today morning , from finland .
that airship on here is equipped , is a flying lab .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between earth and <unk> feet .
the means <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t flies , italy , to get up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
about a lot of hundred <unk> measure the and analyzed the air out how the , chemical reactivity , and on our the things we the ground .
there , so i just explain , up there are we just with the second airship on .
a great a great commission .
and it 's when you so i want , and this is derived from the subject of weather .
that 's so very good .
and here are , a few <unk> .
that airship on , sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way the weather super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degree .
the <unk> say something that , they were still never .
i did i 've got there just wonderful , as a warm days experienced .
the fact , then also not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have for de <unk> as <unk> diamond , for the better said volcanoes go for the underground worlds are the far away 're going through the erosion , by a million years .
only can you , too , is , that 's all over africa , is that then a sense if you to make sense , after a idea , after a sense of questions is it makes sense when the same time in theater at the film <unk> or the blood diamond 's gone .
there , i time , well , what do there really ?
and what to support we there really ?
the end , we were after two years , done .
the ode was actually , not on .
the <unk> came back then <unk> and the project was then .
and a tornado , the zeppelin was in the mast , then at that damaged , that he also the same way down to could .
i was , but not so bad .
we had there 's very good insurance , and they were actually very happy .
that was , which is the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do to be .
yes , what today we do , a very brief <unk> from the of figured out .
what today we do , it 's and that , it 's going to the complexity , it 's going to ask , growth or was .
what today we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do to service of course .
we we need to the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are yes , also , inside , after 10 , six , again , the be replaced .
we replace , the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a little <unk> <unk> , of the germans <unk> and of the oversight is controlled , always , and the time , with more like <unk> , or how we also an airbus .
that 's also <unk> and costs money and must always on also get worse .
the question is : do you actually on ?
you want to keep going to evolve ?
you do larger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what makes you there really ?
about you on the market ?
about you on the <unk> ?
and the course we have in my time , one .
so , we also some <unk> suffered .
how the way , the <unk> zeppelin -- some <unk> has sustained and many times a bust .
the beginning , on the billboard charts , it was the donations from <unk> .
the population of the german age population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes , and he , really broke it was , has the population him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies that , otherwise we were or <unk> i am today anyway , not here and also other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco , with a customer .
behind it was a very <unk> <unk> .
both of projects are , you failed .
so , <unk> .
the same time we <unk> .
there , i did n't a picture that , because we that <unk> emblem still not show you can .
but just in america is now the <unk> the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three of being sold .
with <unk> to what we like a with a partner , the technology , new .
and that 's a great success , but at the dividing , .
two customers are , liquidate been , because it 's not .
why it was not ?
we know it actually already .
either was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america , if you know who did you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham , people have <unk> , have the airship that , have said , 'd , again , again , <unk> , the power of advertising .
there , the did n't , so , <unk> can .
and it was actually as hard in marketing that over to : hey , people call , and flies .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then the same , once a half million .
that 's then .
the zeppelin flies <unk> routes .
it 's the sense , of course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we , also ca n't do advertising , because it 's mouth to speak about and , we 're talking about <unk> sold their voucher could have , and people say , that 's so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , known and who also always on , in the family .
and we 're great 's .
which i , clean to begin with the mistake , you think we 're she .
you could still more flights .
we have so a <unk> the <unk> and we were -- she .
so that is actually also not very much .
we do , advertising .
that 's time a project has been studying the audi sponsored arabic has .
and an audi has that made here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you must , sometimes , the <unk> imagine : do advertising , meaning ?
we have yes , enough ads , but the internet has much change the <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , 's why you today is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , put the <unk> , three , <unk> bought , 10 percent are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
it means that we will then the market , if it all of this is to control .
and hope , it also again a future , something that code .
and what the end with david , scott , commander of the apollo six , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he has said , just at the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> you .
do advertising , also .
just , no regular customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
there we have any customers .
that 's not , has been .
it 's <unk> , is going on and .
so , so a bid takes years until you , but what you .
and then there 's then again , no .
there 's also be funny this effect , the easy for and hard to control .
, is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so , no market .
yet we do on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the force it .
they ask , just about the question : in what form we make it on ?
how much money we give in the market ?
what do what do for here ?
in what form is that by going ?
and i personally , they have to me also asked , something very personal to say , i 'm of the next to my history <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted to go back against the big <unk> , also <unk> this little <unk> dead in to do , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also , once , greenpeace , three years <unk> , when i went through the vancouver island of risks 'm and this whole <unk> come seen have to me , that <unk> , that when i think there . i do .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , in the money from being are and do n't know what they do to be and almost that 's going to basically went from .
there you have to me to employ the three , to <unk> .
and i for three years from greenpeace came from when <unk> and now i am that here in the hope , a future in the zeppelin to achieve .
zero , that right ? of seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that are my three penalty points , i in the eighteen minutes to talk to .
why we are today in from or in the abundance ?
how we come to their ?
and , what to do ?
what 's what 's there really ?
we start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a pretty depressing .
but it 's also the drum , the next to show .
ago , a few years about , that still more difficult to have been , that , to understand .
that we have a problem have today , i know every child .
that we environmental problems .
but it 's worth , always been back time to suggest , are the challenges that growth for example .
all kinds <unk> are rising exponential increase .
if you do it in a historical long view , you see , the oil for example , that a very short , episode in the history has been to be .
the moment , we can not going to discuss that 's kind of different about , as that oil and out on up .
you know the climate change the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , it used to be there 's time the columbian mammoth , we look at the last <unk> years .
that you can also <unk> at the <unk> ' i also , right .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it 's then , if you a little bit more closely with this to sort of the real grand challenges , to the things that 's really to avoid being true , otherwise we 've just in the <unk> , health .
<unk> it mean , days over 30 degree .
and there 's degree , in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , always getting more on a bad .
it 's but also the <unk> , all , in asia .
you think , the himalayas , where the streams <unk> and the <unk> of notes on that there 's always changing the water from the himalayas .
it 's the end , not the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , there 's been much larger environmental crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's going to us to the people , like , in in a the ecosystems , very uncomfortable will live .
it 's going to the loss , biodiversity .
the deserts , spreading .
the water will always less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , from .
and that everything , where that come from ?
all these bad things , say , i time , depend in the , or other form with the global <unk> together .
with the , what we all of the ground , get , what we harvest .
not just the oil and the metals together and the minerals , but also the renewables resources are , renewable , but the end , .
and we should just look , we so little as many of use to also the end , less than waste and the emissions to produce .
it 's so it , that 's in the introduction , said already been the <unk> really dramatically to .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , oh , two , <unk> of a car on a different , but really differently .
different to rebuilding economies .
our technology , to change .
if we , just look at the hunters and moving forward , and there 's still on the earth societies , essentially , so , come with a ton of resources , per person and year .
in a <unk> were it then in the longest time the human history , three to five pounds .
today are it have to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed over the earth .
it 's in north be more than at us at us more than for the earth is unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , look on africa , much less .
and to come , we 's the impact at us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it 's basically , in , that we in other parts of the second shift .
and the other parts of the world , let the but , less like .
and why are also the conflict , we see , of <unk> , is , afghanistan , where , you look , you look at the maps of the american geological survey , and then you see where the resources from .
and that is there 's where there in very colorful , what is , there 's many materials there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with clean want , then we have to begin with the issue going .
so we need to change the ecological limits what we 're all the <unk> is everywhere .
and that , what we here , <unk> lives have is that 's not <unk> .
that has been of mahatma gandhi , were as he said , the world has enough for everybody needs , but not for everybody greed .
and there are we , we here in the average life , very much about .
so .
that was the sort <unk> part .
but i always , you the needs to understand it 's worth , what to change .
however , i later would say , it 's worth , so how so , differently , which is more of their .
but it 's yet , sort , from the <unk> <unk> you need , but a rationale , say , i time .
so , what 's actually their ?
so , we need to , we in our to share the world , so much , have an economically , socially , quality , at the standard , us in the average , often do n't feel .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people , and you sure , people , not so good can deal with this story .
i did the time , there .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we 're working to a lot and to an extensive .
that 's the a side , we get ourselves in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very happy to .
and the other side of we just this <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
how we can that defines what ?
now comes a a little piece of break .
also that , what i did before i 've and what i later tell you 'll is scientific , establishing , but here is it 's just drum , how to sort first time that ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
the quality , the aspect of the objective conditions , how it me about , what i 'm going to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i relationship , i can the life to participate ?
but that i also , how it 's hear me with how to go , i myself , to ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived to quality .
and then <unk> ' i have two words pop into the , the spot .
this is the needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human development , our there 's drum to feelings .
if we our needs to fix , then we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are sustainable , or not sustainable .
needs by se . still not to <unk> .
what are the needs ?
you can kind of scientists , quote , i 've got here 's only two challenges .
and there you of the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
after the protection , and more , <unk> , creativity , spirituality , freedom .
that everything has a bit of what do with money to do .
but to a large part that i ca n't actually , but the question is , how can i think that in my life up .
and there i the second important term .
the strategy .
the strategy , i 'm using the me to is available to me this needs to meet .
and there 's then , drum , that i can , with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
there , much money need a little money .
strategies that are just my devils behave like i mean , needs <unk> .
that has with my values related to , with the resources , with the world , i .
if i little money 've got wind ' i different from my needs to try to fix them as if i sort of much money on the bank account .
it 's first of the <unk> , is the roof over the head , to eat , and then , the <unk> .
and here 's then the drum , that can with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , that can sort that , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies , i 'm going to stand to my needs to satisfy us to summarize , then we talk from a lifestyle .
so .
that was the front of scientific break .
and now let 's drum , what we can do now ?
how it 's how does it ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
now , to that , also , for instance , themselves .
but these are the the individual level of on a technological way , here is , which , i , a lot also about technology 've been and finally , a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , the verge have , i said , the danger is , we sort of the more and consumption , more resources .
the end , the quality of back down , because also the effects , even worse , sort , and on us in the end to beat up .
or , whether we do it , there in a different direction , the , <unk> , may also , that consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's a my <unk> , maybe you know , some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so , a better quality , <unk> .
there 's a lot to technology like , every single thing , that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the car and the traffic , how to that make ?
and cement , today , produce , i can make the house of wood to build , were for .
now , with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> that , so in the <unk> per <unk> , and there we are the , what 's also now , time talking been is , there 's very deep down to go on a 's companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what services , i can actually fix this ?
and how to deal with care as little <unk> do ?
and that 's not with a bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , nine-tenths percent less .
there 's many examples of the that , already .
in vienna , to a building be built with two are allowed .
with seven percent allowed it 's in <unk> already built .
that in essence , from wood that .
that you , it may be in its recent years , not more to break , and then again in its parts and not sort , so , very much less resources out it with all other , you going there , the moment with the half and the goal is , three-fifths of the <unk> , the span of the house that with this type of the <unk> long .
it 's but also a lot in our own , the <unk> ' i really ?
<unk> <unk> has a book written , <unk> .
where he shows , how hard it in the end is , really from the from the sort of treadmill out .
the <unk> , i want to me , go over the others come after , and then i , forever , in this in this race in there .
you put themselves , like , you 're seeing , i quickly hit , and then within . ' i was the new .
the most <unk> ' i the <unk> , that all of you .
when i my research institute , i did some years ago , we still receiving letters i wrote .
then , you , wait , until the letter back to write `` i ai email , is an ai ought <unk> .
to write `` i hundreds of emails .
and i can be very much more afford .
that is productivity , that 's growth , we get the same way to that .
but i did n't really time to go .
i for me , a failure .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance , where i really , the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground , .
and with a low <unk> more of do .
one of my is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling , you has all , ai average person at us in germany , in austria , thousands of things in a household .
you can time to count .
who two years ago , three generations of thousands of things had , had no employees , pick them .
the have to the manage .
we need to myself to deal .
and , less people come to , with these all options .
and we need a <unk> , of us , it , of us , <unk> with these few things in the interest .
what about , which , i really interesting , maybe is also , ai n't use of the spaceship , there 's go down , which , i , also not thousands of things .
the next example is use instead .
a real construction boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> , like , perhaps , 20 years of , in in alternative over been developed .
in the meantime , use it always more people , if you , <unk> thinking .
if you , <unk> thinking .
platforms , and business , just to work , how can the things , we already have these beautiful <unk> here , the years ago , a few hundred years was built still , use and still about the more of years to use it 's about the end .
that , even invested was just better to use .
that 's the end , also a question of justice .
i showed you before , how profoundly unequal , that 's take you that as a picture association between africa and europe and a a <unk> world .
this , so , all the same with these resources economy can 's only then as possible , if we clearly use less .
and that means that 's not less quality , because of us has already , to be much .
but it 's a very important to the economy , the company , these products , those services , really apply to ask the we need to us a good life , with a much less resources .
last point , that has also something with the big public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention , the quest to read , it 's been back of the oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week , this the back after the bottom <unk> .
it means , yes , a crisis is going on the door to my view , and after the , what we , very much , economists had talked to have and with have , here are the numbers for austria , you find that it for all countries growth , just after the bottom .
and there 's no reason , again , growth to have , so , like , of my , from the 1960 , i know .
the part that , in math . one .
one point five percent growth is today , so much like eight percent growth , its recent years .
and that eight percent is that , what china , today .
the are also about there , where we may , its recent years .
in general , if the pie bigger is , of course , harder , eight percent <unk> .
that a percent is still much , so we will be good living .
but you must , like , you put up , that is , not even if we are zero percent growth would have , i would that , the next year , much longer producing and consume and incomes , like in this year .
that we can be good and so we can work .
that 's also why not so wrong , because you these statistics , if you know , the show that growth on , for , not more with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in <unk> countries , about the was , the we are .
and the way , jobs are also , without growth , and the not so deeply connected together , like that us and out of <unk> and how they all say that will .
that just not true , and then you have to , time with the economy going .
and it comes , and increasingly , to , <unk> like a more or next week , which , i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this subject to begin to grapple with .
already <unk> , edward <unk> , then a nobel prize in its <unk> so i asked myself , he said , the good life the good global economy , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
it 's about the end , and not to not primarily to the returns to create , not primarily to growth , what for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and these countries , indeed , china , for india there 's the ai n't very different story .
and that is , only then you out , under <unk> , if we there , still growing , let and we just like , on this level , on this high level , the we 're good on life and economies .
that takes a 's also policy .
it takes your goals .
it takes going to say the economists .
it takes not just sort of that growth , but we should really look , and measure and ask , how about that 's actually with the quality , up the to ?
this is the down ?
and also our politicians .
of course , how high , is the <unk> ?
how does it , together ?
we need a essentially aspect of it 's the <unk> finally to tax , and not the work .
who of them , especially the entrepreneurs live under them , but also the employees , you know that very good .
what sort of the ability to walk , we know all time a colleague paid for .
that you could very different .
the resources are sort down and why are the resources , minus , and not the work .
and you have to the end , all <unk> to change the employment , which to <unk> to ensure the health , infrastructure , without growth .
that 's , but there must you a bit better .
that is , so , more or less , on all levels , in this direction worked , we can be hard , we can be a company , the right products , services as a consumer sort of us , what we actually , how we do this is what 's a good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the politics , by the framework put them .
a couple of evidence , i gave them .
and the end of course , the science <unk> percent of fellow it 's still in the direction , how we can be the growth drive ?
, but nobody did .
if you the the look if you the development and look at the last 20 years , it 's always been , down because it 's not about .
the politics , not and the fellow will not growth to create , but this is the question how we go with the , and it so , we have a good life of ?
so , <unk> 's do it .
be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , hand , and the end , the spirit we 're going to need .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
this city has been so many stories to tell .
a sort of them , ago , a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving and i 'll , and the story , later .
they will have to do with the citadel <unk> .
that 's an ai <unk> , here in the middle of the city is , and a lot of this city , which is , and does .
a different story .
it was in one hot summer in reno and , nevada .
a man , you realize , on once in his shoes , right that 's really <unk> .
that him to it 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he makes then one he pulls the shoe of it takes a knife <unk> also not a spike in , and it 's several times , there are lots of holes in .
he pulls the shoe , there 's not be a knife , and realize he has a climate change in shoe .
it 's the shoe , breathing , born .
and this number , you see here is the space in the <unk> of these billionaires are , mario <unk> is today .
a company is <unk> that , with four letters .
the , or another one of you know it .
he has the original idea , nike and adidas are offered .
both have been refused .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own company .
<unk> is he , the stock market .
with today , several thousand employees in just three hundred of businesses in about <unk> countries in the world .
so much the creative problem-solving .
why not something new to make up , what 's still not there is ?
and mario question , maybe the question i asked the , with <unk> exam , it .
if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what is that a chance ?
this question , has to me , often been able to in a tough .
if something that 's gone wrong is , or my collaborator <unk> me or a technology does n't work or what .
<unk> , little fuzzy memory , <unk> .
what is that a chance ?
and , you get from <unk> into <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , of the <unk> <unk> now , and that the <unk> of behavior of <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people can be , if it to their own insurance .
i want you a few examples here .
the so these are actually so , the <unk> <unk> and the has it also an ad .
i <unk> , in the amazing .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , and this is the wife by the <unk> <unk> .
or i had the whole day , plants is where when i the intersection had reached , grew up a sudden , the bush in my view , and i was the other car will not see more .
very clear , who 's blame this is , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two , almost died .
there you can tell me , but at least that half <unk> on .
the last thing i was , the crash , not doing .
blame this was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is each other kind of shelves obsolete .
if you , but a woman who are , you know it anyway .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of them , we all the more of creativity to use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that must n't be that .
why do things just time i do differently ?
old the things we do the present , from become are , perhaps , bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just time i do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , the use that .
for instance , <unk> , have yet these <unk> of their by those are , these signs , or , the wall , for example , and there is then maybe so what it .
also a way , right ?
time the coffee set to stay instead , <unk> .
, something .
we do n't put wifi , <unk> you .
this is yes , today , regular , right ?
if you the phone , not anything you can .
or food they look at me , otherwise , starving , we both .
rude , creative .
so we need something as .
i do something , in terms of the customer , or an environment , then go , and say , okay , that i like .
that <unk> ' i like .
a german <unk> has in the should do the current day <unk> , and it in <unk> .
once the sport , the current economic news , once upon politics .
if you there are three times the loo was , is you <unk> .
even got the complaint about to long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and the restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all of hands of business .
it was to look closely .
the have thought , together , what do ?
how we 're solving the problem ?
we can not faster , in the kitchen .
this idea is to form .
on every table , interrupted <unk> <unk> set fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so , that , an environment , wait on it to eat your <unk> , time themselves they 're able to .
just time different .
a creative idea , and may also with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person the power , currently not just a popular .
you this person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> yes , the german , very much .
already the second day , that takes it , a monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> , and the month , one , and you might say , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people to us to book <unk> .
the buses that are full , it will <unk> run , people together , in a carpool , because each of course , other hand , because for , of a , to b to come .
but why not time , of something , and creative , from his great do something ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> maybe it turns out , in the company , that you might .
so we have , you know that , where the <unk> n't really good about , but that they look at the <unk> also , saving to , this is something to worry .
or the <unk> in the car .
there , we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , not a piece from the car on , if you <unk> 's right ?
or at <unk> there 's also , creative to create .
and all that has to do just with humor , with joy , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , i think about the office .
and sitting on this <unk> ago me .
so , we have multiple <unk> , around the <unk> .
and then it turns out he of the left to right , so , pleasure , and i in my stinking <unk> say , to the you to stop on , that is yes , not a playground .
he to me , at me , big eyes , but the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually , right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that is something , but much more sense , right ?
if we sort of these are , if we our talents to use to do that , what we like to do .
and to excellence in , but very different way .
that dip to is that , if a particular day , the week , coming then it changes , what in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow it 's our focus on a other day .
so , other day , we mostly , better .
so in the weekend .
that you 're yes , already in the media .
on thursday is yes , only still a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time the year , announced , the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's so awful ?
we all so terrible jobs ?
a <unk> it had a time on the front , this topic .
yes , monday , you can , i and the rest of life , please do .
or on <unk> , on facebook , all over the social networks is this issue up .
once was walking , i do the <unk> , the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of businesses and i look at me , like this .
what have the so in the <unk> , there 's so ?
and one day , stuck , i 'm going on this business with these signs , buy .
and the first sign , that you see here , yes , that is yes , very nice .
so , with so i do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , i 'm a father of five children , but i 'm also my work now .
yes .
or still <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset , there 's degree , becomes , and that is increasingly , and always on .
somebody has been there time as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the face monday , it are your jobs .
and i ask even in fact , with the pink , glasses , here forward to come and say , okay , ' time shift .
what , my job is beautiful ?
that sucks is , let 's the pink , glasses , is , it looks like all the same kind of like before .
so something beautiful to talk to do n't that is beautiful , it 's clearly not .
the pink , we 've let 's the way , super , bike , drive .
there holding you a wonderful , the flying from the else in your land , you .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
to that , if we do n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , as <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we like that we feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this wheel , and running and running and it , and eventually , it to quickly , this wheel , it happened with the poor mouse and they response out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , she goes back in the <unk> .
and again , and again and perhaps the movie , every day <unk> that <unk> you may , falls , yes , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , there 's a failure and it 's and over again , so there .
and that , what we as funny there 's probably has the mouse and eventually , concussion , yeah ?
or something needs it , <unk> <unk> .
i felt it , many years , so when i along was a couple of students at home .
and on once , so the street under me , felt it was very , black , my eyes and somehow got , i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there on ?
he got me and said , no way , is that 's all right .
but like so <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , to bring that test , and saw , i worked for three weeks , and somehow bugging me , the job .
after two years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first thing in the early , asking whether we look at night , to end you can do .
i also thought , what 's actually , otherwise , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities to me , to look , time with my family <unk> , something good for me themselves do .
<unk> , whether it 's not sure ai other <unk> there in my job , a new of light .
i realized , the talks , large groups , make me , pleasure .
, ' , like , and counseling and <unk> and also other things , but these talks by pulses be happy to the experience to share the <unk> i really profound joy .
and that was n't always been so .
i 've got myself what you have to realize that <unk> stress sick .
and sometimes need it 's really this shot , the the so , <unk> of me that 's degree back from the hospital , let 's been , after he 's a heart had , and on once he starts also , <unk> .
they used as i said , you with some jogging , so , i 've always <unk> , yes , you with your running and so .
today is he themselves .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in real <unk> , but , we also , together , jogging , go .
what ?
the bottom line , we all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , goes , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the shrink the last 10 years , <unk> , minus its percent , that 's beautiful , that is less .
of the rise of psychiatric disorders , plus & percent .
that 's something , where i think , to that does not be ?
why is that ?
that 's just in austria , so ?
no , also in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , that everything will be healthier .
that 's so here on the left side to recognize .
very bottom of psychiatric disorders , plus a hundred percent within the last 10 years , a a big german <unk> out .
the <unk> psychiatric drugs , to .
also the cost .
and it 's think , all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
do to go away sometimes come , it , involuntary <unk> , , for example here .
so it 's good .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol , is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which gives us , but again , healthy , and the task , and with pleasure to ?
and that , i was the last years .
i thought , there 's so something like <unk> , it , all be ?
i figure , the job is not that , what we <unk> has and happy to do .
there 's many other things , are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is , we the the most of our <unk> in the work to spend .
and if we do that , then why not that you do , it gives us pleasure for takeoff and also the other .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> , as the last , for so to <unk> and , <unk> .
these little had no , you , hopefully then it easier to realize it .
<unk> is for their talent and to the freedom and environment .
that is , like <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in which the environment , do , i think that , with whom ?
what kind of freedom . i ' i 'm here , that to do , what i want to do ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> , of us <unk> .
the more of the more and more stress .
and what i do it ?
the use .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for instance , myself doing .
i had that for me to myself doing , a few years , and i do that constantly , .
can i mean , talents to use ?
in which the environment ?
and that is , sometimes you go , i in a coffee with my laptop the seminar prepare a <unk> .
the freedom .
what to , i can take to bring that do , what i do is .
and do i do it also ?
the use .
the last ted u .
and then there 's , people , made me to explain why do n't that 's about .
and why this at them much harder .
then i mostly , like an answer , .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't , has the reasons .
and by , i can you pick <unk> ' i ways , within . ' i ways , or i did , i reasons why ?
and they 're going in both right .
what do you do with our talents somewhere else ?
each of them has his great <unk> around .
the is yes , small .
the 's filled with the same talent , with the gold , with all kinds , with their skills .
what do it ?
by the end we ask that .
or if we in the hospital , who are or the end of life .
what i started with my talent done ?
the way , who here 's got has on <unk> <unk> , like , later , here 's still access .
so , what do with our talents , is so my first question , also , i consider myself , and that every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was , but still something with a story .
the i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i , the still do .
fortress is this was the saving for the <unk> ago when shrink hundred years , the end up .
and the men realized that the fortress is this so well , built was , you do n't take could .
thick walls sixties ways , the <unk> to the fortress , thick and doors , <unk> , many times on .
i was <unk> time .
so we thought , this , okay if we do n't get , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and in .
time looking at how long , in the that there , goodness .
the <unk> it was from long until the day , where the supplies , it were .
they had only still a <unk> the was already on the way to being slaughtered them to be as the <unk> on once the bishop says , the bishop give me this <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you <unk> , i <unk> , you , come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> about with the <unk> way .
on even see it down the how about the wall of the fortress is a <unk> moved , is led and out of the left to right , and in the early .
well , thinking , , a <unk> , what is that now .
it 's <unk> .
again , <unk> <unk> , the top of wall of the fortress , this is he however , black .
enemies are thinking , oh , still has two <unk> , it can , still something , it .
at night i did the scenario , , this is he knows the <unk> , there on and go from here is led .
the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom , they were in a <unk> .
because they thought , that takes us to long , that we hold on myself not more .
and then went to the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the a , they had and the they <unk> .
that are the <unk> <unk> to form .
i like this idea , all right there is , what we need , and that we have everything .
're sometimes it from the resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little bit .
but also , so we can help but do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world every day to invent .
and if you think , that could now a good <unk> be then you have right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there goes away the snow , there is a 's getting there 's the plants , of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> .
there to see blooms eventually come from these blooms fruits .
there are coming from apple here 's very popular , then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain , which we can then the ground and the bread in baking .
there 's any animals , that eat .
there 's people , then the products that it later , food .
and it comes .
but when you think about that perhaps not so automatically translates everything is then is a 's a fear and so anxious .
and of course is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and , theoretically , but just in the blooms , the connection of the flower to plant to play the bees a very , great .
there 's research , to show up to <unk> percent of our food , up food is n't there were if we ca n't make bees have .
also that sounds like , so <unk> , because it that normal for us is , and we need bees might also not so they perceive .
there 's now , some time , a very interesting movie , <unk> , `` the .
and i 'm going to them , look at it .
now , but look forward , we went on the lord <unk> , which is just with the bees are working , in his school , in <unk> the importance of bees , the power .
that does he here in school , <unk> and he 's going to us now a lot about his work to tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time a thank you , mr. <unk> and all that <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> contribute something you can think about that live in the bees .
and that 's also still under a wing of <unk> something about a little <unk> to tell the fun .
there i think , the most of you <unk> in the 're doing it 's now today at night a <unk> company , in eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping bring to go .
that do i do n't , no .
but maybe you get it 's me , you to that you this <unk> start to love or a kind of empathy to them to develop and you to engage for this <unk> youth-led , <unk> insect in the honey .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young when i 'm with an incredible wife annie perasa married , father of five children still not <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and work for <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our oldest living amongst students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in the agriculture and in the urban beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play of <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .
our personal flying classroom is more than a <unk> , a silence , a quiet .
and they are that 's also to peace .
it 's almost a <unk> matter .
and not free have been the old , greeks are the connection between the honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful little verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping , then have to him to inspire , he again , dense .
but the <unk> go up to do n't recognize themselves , but they send their blue bees and <unk> now the poet the lips , with the wax and we crawl in the mouth into , and out with him later , the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a gorgeous image .
hopefully you get me that today , tonight .
yes .
that echoes of the classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the way that now my students with me , built have come for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> into school or in the <unk> in the another one of <unk> or in the <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in classrooms , us in <unk> .
the teacher , this project by about with me in the class , and we 're looking for a , put in place for that in a <unk> .
most of the window to the children , can see during this month .
and , all things , with the bees , then there are in the blow up out and again <unk> can .
there is then the window , the slot .
so .
and then begin by the at me on the <unk> .
i was so a <unk> and <unk> , now from a term <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you now here in this <unk> in .
so important on this on this <unk> are <unk> so the bees .
also important , we have here <unk> their , and here to the edge , fresh their be , so fresh eggs .
and then that i also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey is inside .
the they need to take a bad weather is , and they do n't fly .
so .
that looks like then from .
then comes the <unk> here again on and begins immediately the transportation , for <unk> places , or , the for <unk> place in the school .
and now begins , an amazing .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there , then in the class are now , suddenly a crisis .
their people 's not more .
they are lonely .
they find your queen did n't .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he this <unk> order to that he looked at paying the queen the old people are left .
that the so not on these two <unk> sitting .
and they are sad , these bees .
they start , to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen 's coming together .
and now begins with a <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in a night to you now , the necessity , a new people to the reasons , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without the conferences , without having , opinions and you .
here is the nation , agree and it then in the first night , here 's a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this people , after six weeks , not more exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and in this first night , get you from one of <unk> a out a fertilized egg , and bring that in this <unk> in .
and there <unk> to then it ai queen going .
everybody , of you <unk> in the high was , says , how do that go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , but that 's all genetically <unk> .
that 's true .
and now begins , an amazing .
this egg , what here , in the <unk> a cabinets , has been doing it 's going in the <unk> a queen .
the egg , the first three days , the same genetic code , <unk> .
and then it will be fed a couple of <unk> <unk> .
you know this term .
and instantly it changes , this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier , time i heard that , what we eat , that determines the idea of us .
and the queen is that really wonderful to see .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all witness .
that you see in class .
and then is this cell <unk> with a <unk> wax and the whole thing happens , not that , because the people now that democratic to <unk> or because of <unk> says , so it is to be , you republican back a group , says , you do that now .
no , that happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then , waiting for the students eight days , my student knows , three , five times eight a queen , so <unk> days that these queen <unk> .
and the day , if that then so this happen to the teachers has that wrote in the <unk> there <unk> the nightstand to the students up to five o'clock , yeah .
and then he says the mother , say a time , what 's because with you go ?
yes , i have to the school .
yes , why that ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning to six in the school .
and then you squeeze the , their <unk> down , this <unk> , because you witness to , like the queen 's now <unk> .
and if you that really can experience then you hear the first is something .
this queen 's whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then get the <unk> and cut these queen going free .
the first , what these queen , they spread over their wings , and there are now , <unk> this people , myself a queen i pulled that has their own smell , you <unk> , of pheromones .
the nation has now , again , identity .
now going to three or five days for the queen fed up .
the <unk> front do you their <unk> <unk> .
the back to come from the they turn out , from the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days , flying this queen 's one of the <unk> out .
some of thinking now , yes , i 've been a time ever seen , a <unk> in <unk> .
, to stop .
what 's completely different .
-- that we let me .
this queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without the guards , from this <unk> out to two miles high .
they have surely , time ever seen in your zeppelin .
in the <unk> , and there in an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the way , like in islam , where the man different women have to here is the queen , the seven to 12 , men .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone could come back of <unk> this queen , and this queen of it now in an flight all that , what we use , seeds need to for three years eggs to put them .
for the drone is it also a an experience .
if you 's done with the <unk> dies , and it 'll be dead by the sky .
and then comes the queen goes back and starts , eggs to put them .
it 's always a , two students in the class , that immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and then we end , the project in the school because now , the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the <unk> is that now to look closely in there .
and then come , i one night , then before , <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> , though , and the next morning <unk> ' i do this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there , here you 're still the queen .
yes .
it 's fresh <unk> .
and around , mostly about 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then comes this , these two <unk> come from now here in a <unk> .
in a full floor , in a particular prey and now , this people , and they 're going .
why bees in the school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the children , that have to forget that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not just so , in this class , then the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school . yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when he 's something you know , when he 's something can , when he when he said , there something for it has the can a history , and after the other people .
look , bees and this ai anti-poverty ago <unk> years we cave , where the people , the honey and it .
ago , a few months , in israel environment , years old <unk> found in africa where the people at the bees thought would have .
any human culture has with the bees lived together .
or vice versa , the bees were at every culture .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece , in rome .
everywhere , they were in .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , which flowers , or the trees , the bees <unk> , what you need ?
that you out there are now , anything you find , now in summer of agriculture .
that out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can tell ourselves with the students in the gardening , and there , flowers and the bees are able to the <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right now , from <unk> to my kids flowers ?
how long are you on the individual , blooms ?
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can ai <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
so you know whether that 's so , in the <unk> the top to go up is , or ai n't flat on to go up is ?
let me , right .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on this <unk> discover .
and then comes he to the question , was karl , fresh <unk> the nobel prize , even get ?
because he accepted , that the bees can see that in the hive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
there 's like this also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> , the university , she has the has in <unk> to discover that the bees , there a <unk> create the individual <unk> .
like a <unk> net of the wax into the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> there that , and the bees , the <unk> , picked up with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see what these bees in the school do ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose your fear , the bees .
and develop a awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look what the bees do .
and they get a warning , these creatures , what , took only for us people who lives .
the bees to wax still not , 40 pounds per people in the year .
ago <unk> years , the only way to come to make .
they collect , the budding and outside , the trees that <unk> .
that 's a <unk> , <unk> they their people from .
and now imagine you time ago , in summer , that are their sixties , , <unk> bees on that 's a narrow the room , <unk> degree .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases , without end .
no , the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> one of antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and it , it <unk> , he will , <unk> , a able <unk> .
someone , the , the <unk> 're now is , with pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go and a <unk> to let , by he the <unk> of the people <unk> .
of course , there 's a grid , before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , there do n't happen .
yes , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have less apples , if the bees and there was n't fly , or we have like the chinese , the <unk> <unk> and they themselves locally .
there 's much more these interrelations .
you look at the <unk> , there is the meadow , there is also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows graze again .
and there is flying the bee , , then , their nectar and it 's fermented -- these <unk> .
and now comes the cow and <unk> the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick up here is , they digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you go back and realize , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i ca n't it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to good end of those the bee keeping us that most valuable , what it on the from the nature , there .
the honey .
i still just to the point to come , <unk> .
my students to be happy , every year , if you this <unk> build and then it partially covered with me , in the schools .
that 's now , not my <unk> but , i had a student , and there , i said , in <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> , put you get themselves .
and then he says , yes , i hot , <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> , <unk> and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and for two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm ' me , now , not more with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands can learn .
<unk> , yes , with her head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> school .
and more than half the said , oh yes , that we also .
my students see here , for the appreciation and the put between , in quotes -- the normal and the those people are going through the bees , salvaged .
on playing field to you , and they get their self-confidence , my students and a certain amount of the home .
how you going to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how you , <unk> the <unk> ?
so , mum , i , there 's the human being the other people <unk> and he 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with it .
but at a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee , the sun across the <unk> feel the way to flower , and never the direction , you lose the sides of the fields in <unk> glory , like a moment he also lived , he would ever do n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in all the world .
welcome to talk from my project .
the project i was a person and my wife .
it 's the struggle for a the female <unk> .
in my eyes that 's greatest crimes of humanity , because it their been in terms of years .
the society against the women with still a thousand to a day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there , i <unk> years a <unk> .
you , think that i was the job , not <unk> .
and i do n't <unk> .
and it 's why i was happy , i put in the subject <unk> well <unk> and exciting potential of arises when i could .
for this .
with a massive <unk> about the news of africa , after brazil .
the sail a plea on the <unk> brazil in the demise of genocide , the wild . indians from the <unk> , to stop .
that was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet we were these kinds of a match , that interest in the media to find and even a small person like i was his cause global in the language to .
<unk> i started with this firsthand the caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
then there was there 's war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings , there .
and despite all the cruelty , we 're experiencing , we experienced the other side of the infinity hospitality of <unk> , into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we invaded you were and our two guards , you see here , with their bodies as living took on us <unk> , and the insulting said that are my an environment .
if you the killing you want you by us through it shoot .
something similar , i was in any other human culture .
and then in boys , already learned , you islam , not can reduce the terrorism .
also , christians who want yes , not reduced to be on their terrorism .
, <unk> .
the -- the <unk> .
but rather on the real value , how to charity , social responsibility , the <unk> .
these are the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i came again in this <unk> been , with my wife <unk> .
and there were we then of this <unk> female <unk> .
when i then heard that , nine-tenths of everyday . <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> . i ' i thought about how can a <unk> how many of islam , next to type of terror , that still <unk> in the shoes , it let me ?
and the idea was the highest in africa of islam to the need to sin to understand .
we 're looking for the comrades in german organizations , we do n't found .
there had to do we then hear that now we would be yes , completely <unk> , of islam -- was n't <unk> .
you would i the throat to cut ribbons .
on <unk> of amnesty , and internationally , we then <unk> our own organization , .
and they were of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and to now this battle , even to win to can we needed the images .
it was a lack .
and so moved <unk> and i went back in this desert , with the hidden camera these pictures .
the bad as a bloody images , i show you do n't , but i want to briefly that crime , drawing .
girl , the age of four weeks to , the wedding be some of their parents and related picked , the planet , placed you , again , the limbs , and cutting them without anesthesia , the clitoris right , and the <unk> . ab : does with a <unk> the <unk> to , without anesthesia , with <unk> instruments , knowledge of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> to agglomerate .
what you 've left is a small aperture of the size of <unk> .
an takes well , 15 minutes .
if you your rule to ask you two weeks .
that destroyed , body and soul , it their labors would .
that was the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the virgins 's on .

the uncle , have him , oh , ibrahim , but that 's no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis , <unk> , and then one you very hard .
and if you get it does n't it , is also not bad .
then take you that knife and <unk> you on .
that 's <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of girl .

but they do n't seem to believe , there praying .
they imply <unk> , a <unk> to be the women 's wrong , has created and why you , well as <unk> person having could produce , women <unk> .
but now we had the images of the comrades and this was <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the great that , the practice is against all rights , the religion , we need to him one .
as recently , the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , you know , just that has for these people are valid .
and it was celebrating , and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example , , <unk> there <unk> us the highest pragmatically , the <unk> the country on his message , it is a crime , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were along , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had in .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , the hospitality -- experienced .
and when we the country , eventually , they said the big scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to really all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you ca n't even more .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> , you have to slow to the thing to come .
and , he had an idea .
he said , if it you get the ten <unk> muslims , the world , a table to and the explain the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo , in the <unk> and -- the mosque to begin with the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he heard , the idea , was thrilled , all , , as we 're going to make , we finance this would .
and we do that just about the funders of the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference is not just <unk> , we do it 's been asked them had , but i 'm going to the <unk> taking .
and that he has done .
over cairo <unk> some point in the years <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to ban on the <unk> the female parts of times by female .
the <unk> the <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> .
and all these are they did .
a hundred with guards , but the highest in the world .
in the middle <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe and he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men the life and death can decide .
but that i also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about where i <unk> me just still a vacuum , and <unk> personally .
and then i know , appreciating them .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> of the left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of my wife , mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much , the topic of islam is not <unk> .
we also the doctors , by the on their way , <unk> , terrible , you women there will do , <unk> .
and then to <unk> your film to show <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they moved , back behind closeted kind of doors , just two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> of years ago , the cameras , declared , what you 've decided to communicate .
and the most important set , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime , that against the highest values of islam , here .
he hound you the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done , but the calculation even without our <unk> .
because the shame , about the abdomen using the woman to talk , is stronger -- stayed when everybody 's mind .
it 's why we <unk> .
we have this we have the conference , documented in this so-called `` golden rule book .
a <unk> for the <unk> this world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , the book , so , it with a <unk> blessed .
it 's going to us from the earth gush forth .
we were in many countries had then conferences , we do with the parts of the highest clergy like .
and they read that with interest in some were so excited , the book <unk> .
unfortunately , but we have the most not the courage to put this , that now , to announce that .
about the abdomen using the woman you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage to put this .
they 're at least in the universities are gone , on <unk> .
and sometimes we have some of bold <unk> found the fact , in the mosque , <unk> have , here .
and then it comes out about some speakers in the <unk> .
and that are yes , the individuals .
the will it spread .
but i 'm going , the time .
it are all drop on the hot rocks , and it , i work , many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .
the practice of arguments that .
but my <unk> that this .
i want to the great message the highest clergy like the world to announce the birthplace of islam is here , the kaaba , in mecca .
not , so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if here four million people together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all , and the convinces king of my transparent up there between the mosque minarets collateral .
how i think that here , time , you 've seen in the <unk> .
unfortunately , who 's me , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he of <unk> he would join .
one thing , to these women to help .
the other , to the time to show , which the real value of islam , are , instead , the time to demonstrate to happen .
of terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that do then <unk> ' i might this , in hamburg , its had .
that at least a lot <unk> in the beautiful mosques up in all the world .
and we have , transparent , there collateral thinking could .
and may experience , i do it 's still , that little girl , his daughters were n't even more <unk> to .
then , my life that really worth it .
and i appeal , every , that now heard , or seen has to join .
also not join this is already a <unk> .
we need to the practice in the ton step , otherwise , right here i of this stage , not .
and now i want to conclude the design of my <unk> , even show .
that 's my <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's in all major languages up there in arabic in the name of the <unk> and <unk> that always have to anticipate .
down there we have it , in german .
female <unk> is with the koran , and the ethic of islam is incompatible .
you is <unk> and a discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i start again , so that time .
so we saw the <unk> from , you as a refugee camps in germany .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i first time to a package <unk> .
and , it <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand , why the us now rotten food have given .
the third day , we finally get resolved .
we were the trash to say , again , throw away then came a <unk> wife and those that just fiercely against <unk> .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
that 's not , well .
that tastes , very good .
it 's cheese .
my mother was the eyebrows , and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my country , we , <unk> but the has not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
ago fifteen years , i came up with my mother and my brother of china , germany had fled .
this kind of escape <unk> ' i tell ourselves now .
but , it 's going to me about the people , this run to have and to a success did .
but first , tell , i 'm going to where now , i 'm from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , in the northwest of china .
and this region is the chinese that autonomous area <unk> challenges .
it 's about <unk> miles of germany away .
in china to live in 10 million <unk> but in munich , is the <unk> community of china .
and this <unk> life , so here because we in china under the continuing abuses of suffering .
hundreds of chinese were extra to <unk> relocated , so we in our own home to a minority become aware .
our own native language , <unk> was kind of education system so much .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese students .
and our religion to do we also not free to act .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and if , somebody accidentally set is , and for the right to the <unk> service of being a long sentences , torture , or even after death .
that was also the reason , why my parents , that we decided to have , with us kids to escape .
that was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
that photo is a moment ago , what we can escape .
we did n't enough money , so my father had only time behind .
i <unk> ' me , many people , at the run have helped .
i <unk> ' me , many images .
i <unk> ' me , but first , <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just know , it right , me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had an ai <unk> , , and we met him , with his little lada on a lot .
the first rate was going to pass .
i know , a lot of a negative image of <unk> have that the only do business plan to refugees use and , not for the fates are interested .
but i '' `` say , '' `` it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> us has conducted months with him .
he was the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last end <unk> , whether we also really sure the <unk> up .
airport in <unk> we came , and i know , how to my mother to somehow i said that 's just turned out of the airport .
turns out to you 're not to .
until we 're out .
because i had , in my hand a pass , and there was also my photo in but there was a stranger name , <unk> .
i had as <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' me , <unk> <unk> of me at he had my pass in the hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a slow at .
we were finally <unk> .
in munich , came <unk> ' i , many , the first , sort of very strongly supported .
i <unk> ' me , <unk> woman , with us in <unk> used for .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 families .
at least of children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger whose faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was being eaten , you 've made and done homework .
friends who came to do n't want to visit , because i <unk> , where we <unk> .
just my <unk> the <unk> in the another know you know .
they knew my story and <unk> me , and you care , me .
for instance , brought me tell you to <unk> <unk> what i 'm going to do n't know , i do .
but they helped me , somehow , german people were able to meet .
i spent my whole bunch of the <unk> .
that was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids , without your husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had yes , just a <unk> and we could have any deported .
i <unk> ' me , that i said , really aggressive was to the time .
it 's me also a little bit embarrassed , that now here 's all to tell , but now i have to just to my history .
i was very aggressive and i could tell me in the school bad kind of focus .
the 1980s brought us in the first to the catholic <unk> where we first time to deal with a normal human children in touch up .
with a normal , my goodness ' i children , not in a <unk> , had .
i <unk> ' i was also , <unk> the me and my brother . to the post-conference tours , or <unk> to have .
just so we bit out .
i <unk> ' i was also , several <unk> <unk> the with us homework done have , because our parents did n't speak german , could .
or the have with us just painting .
we 've always very excited .
i know , the way we always going on the fence line up and waited until these people came , because , kind of took , strangers , people for us , and that was telling us at the things .
after two years , came finally , my father , germany .
the problem was , but , he directly from <unk> after <unk> deported was because it in munich a supposedly , no place , for him , there .
i <unk> ' me , very , who she the it has managed to my father , the <unk> after china to keep us they made it , that he was at us in munich , having me .
i <unk> ' me , this time where i really , then , really glad i was , because after six years <unk> got we finally in a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , your home with a own <unk> and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was , very small and i did n't desk in , but it was very well , i was my door , going .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , very well used to have , but i had yet , another without a to leave .
i looked for me really not a perspective .
there was a <unk> , made me in <unk> always been supported , and it still do with the idea that i think about the second and exposing and my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thank the teacher , really , i thought , and i was really not just to the time i made i do it even to the middle at that .
and i , <unk> .
and before i , <unk> and i played the way with my best friend <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was no good <unk> that i did , i also only done because we by <unk> a place , where we simply could go .
we had a valve , what we <unk> <unk> could .
and the ladder of <unk> helped us to somehow that we our problems with him tell you could and he <unk> us and i could tell us at all of questions of elected officials .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a school , and the opportunity to get , being artistic <unk> .
that has to me really very well done , and i realized , art is something what i can also a little bit <unk> .
by <unk> and the contact to <unk> was a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of awards .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 's still never had had to people we were listening .
and that was so a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more n't .
i mean anything from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees from me on the idea , to a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join me .
but there i put in the bold building , totally enveloped me go , i ended up at random at a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was right .
i was playing with .
and the great is , after a performance of the two editors , from <unk> broadcasting , on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i interest , just time , your <unk> to do .
i thought , super , golden ticket .
i realized i do , i do with .
and i did for the program marking <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and of my vital contributions about a play <unk> , i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated vice versa .
and i told him , actually won .
by studying , i the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and that everything would be for me not been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me being used to have .
they have , i did you have to me spaces were open , they have to me ways that one , i my place in the society , i <unk> can .
and to come , i now to them .
each of them has the way , people like me to help the second chance to get and their lives or their place in the society .
because the people , every day to shrink a hundred million refugees in munich , and each of you 're full of hope and each of them has a huge potential .
they have it with a resolve it is that many terrible are behind it .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany , and for every single one of us .
and i could actually thousands of things to tell what you can make , but there i do n't even more than enough time we 've even though there is , a minute and its , i put them a <unk> brought .
extended , you now your appendix out they can not let me tell you to no code <unk> can .
scan you the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with you suggestions , and we can do .
and that would take us very good to help .
i thank me now , time for their engagement and we see outside , i hope .
and then scan you the code .
i just know , it .
many have the phone , not in the hand .
you so i 'm going to become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yeah .
first time a <unk> <unk> was .
to me , we touch .
my name is a robin chase .
my <unk> is write , simpler than it talks .
i come , in terms of austria , that 's in vienna .
i 'm ' me and yet , very , today in <unk> to attend , is really beautiful here .
i would be here every time , probably .
and that 's not a phrase , that 's a sense .
yes , yes , unlike in to the other <unk> i 'm not here today , to you about anything to a little overboard .
i did n't know , about .
but it 's so , that i write in my spare time , and then , some talk , mostly at <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just <unk> like the world today .
yes , and i was also today i asked , here 's a couple of the talk to read the the program a little <unk> .
and exactly the wind ' i now here .
yes .
i start with a joke .

he says that , so , are two , chickens and i <unk> you up and <unk> so not <unk> , but <unk> been a very funny . i <unk> you up and <unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
he says that , yeah .
hey , and just ca n't <unk> me .
here we have the level of a roadway .
the first text is a little <unk> , that i time , i did .
i , it was a person 's devoted the me the part of what does .
it 's wearing the <unk> .
and yeah , has it was visiting ourselves , not understand .
when your head in my lap , was sleeping under your rest under my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling , your leg , the ceiling .
my leg , for the ceiling .
it 's about her head is , on my lap , dear , the rest of her camping under the ceiling , my leg , under the ceiling , her leg of the ceiling .
that has <unk> , as if only my leg is extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the text , i also at a person 's devoted the me very much means .
and that my grandpa owned .
we have no contact with more .
my <unk> grandfather was of a butcher paper .
already as a child , with love drawing was cut .
about me , yeah .
yes , 'n text .
better be the world .
jesus is the rescue is the sticker , the glass of the bus .
but where jesus was when he told me , on this sticker <unk> `` save them to ?
there to think , yeah ?
i was my <unk> been brought ?
so i text .
the next text is a little bit more .
he takes a half hours .
so , writing .
read about it faster .
this is the beginning of a novel , i degree in the <unk> write .
ah , it 's going to <unk> guys , so the adventures , from a guy , again , the hair them and a little to a lot <unk> .
i <unk> ' me , and out , of the hallmark i themselves .
because i '' `` i 'm never the hair dyed .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head up empty .
so abandoned like the sheet , that he now to fill it 's trying .
yes , i 'm not come .
very hard half hours .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people understand it .
i do , i myself , too hard .
and it comes that , i play , like with my own lexicon , and with my language .
i , always been to speak with me .
and yes , come , these things out .
it 's wearing the <unk> .
this is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
this is probably the <unk> <unk> , that i ever had written .
<unk> we can .
yes , we came frozen .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can do .
i can not .
i can not .
yes , i did it themselves , not understand .
no idea .
yeah , to clap of me .
i say , always , either , or no .
the next sheet , has also do with text .
it 's kind of so a little <unk> .
i , in the time for the insects is written .
very polite .
yes , 'n text .
is a little <unk> .
and it 's about how cool , when i 'm so , do that her three to tell you might be .
my text , the title , all good things are really cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we 'll figure <unk> .
so to cuddle this , <unk> , <unk> and from scratch and then is the better and yes , that 's it .
beautiful , and managing the moment .
yes , 'n <unk> , that 's time , other .
and it 's about how cool , when i 'm so , do , that we all so this ai n't kind <unk> could do , so 'n try that we all time .
alright , so , that what the wind power , .
the wearing the <unk> and about this .
yes .
it makes fun , you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write , so like little <unk> .
this is a visualize sexual pun .
sexual is with <unk> s written .
<unk> s ?
yes , yeah .
it makes fun , you .
yes , 'n sentence .
the is in <unk> written .
this is a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain this is the point .
here , a text .
this day is a <unk> .
this is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he has it already know , before i do it as such <unk> .
he has me an idea of just being , then i would he told me <unk> .
i could me later , in him <unk> .
i 'm going to the joy .
it as <unk> ago all other days of quitting , and me back to sleep laid down .
with a <unk> <unk> the face where else ?
and the intention , it 's not more to honor to i <unk> .
and should i later , back up , it , not to a going day , it .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a joke .
what i said , and albert einstein , when he would be a steak , she ?
i is a q .
so .
the letter q and sounds like the cow .
so that 's funny .
yes , the text , has also the middle of her learned .
this is more what political .
so , i write , not just fun things .
i write , also partially very political things .
and it 'll ' i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and yeah , there . i ' i just this text message here is written .
he 's wearing the <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , in my mother and i from her .
yes .
if we have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yes , here , '' `` i 'd like a little do advertising .
i can not a business or so afford , so i have to that always <unk> do .
and that <unk> ' i also ourselves , events and i ended up , also ourselves a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can you 'd like time in .
and yes , i <unk> , i <unk> , actually very <unk> .
and yeah .
that you want , `` i just have said .
it 's going on the program .
more advertising .
that 's a little advertising , i time i wrote .
feet .
rich , vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
already a very funny .
i want , a joke about the <unk> your friend and writing , but the punch it was just pretty flat .
yes , is not been on my <unk> .
<unk> you have to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> you have to make the <unk> out of it .
yes .
thank you for a 's listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
they let me the same with a <unk> question .
why do you <unk> all do ?
i mean , everybody , over it should , ask , if he least some potentially of society , what you back .
the answer is obvious .
we know now , the life , at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
it means that it has to any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why we know it still so little ?
why we will have been bombarded by the <unk> messages from the <unk> , the part of each disagree with ?
you remember , all , six years , to the guilty .
it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food , may see , we all got and be healthy old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in the way the has led and what does n't buy it has changed the americans every year 's become aware .
then , you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are some carbs .
now what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so this has led .
it is so , ai new <unk> hurdle , it 's the village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , the least , we by <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal isolated cases , of wisdom <unk> .
example in for a <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> all of you .
<unk> published a lot <unk> magazine , a new <unk> .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards , was seven years for the number one got .
then , the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest standing man , the evidence shows ever experienced the earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's somewhere , people , say , they are six , but now their <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and they stopped with <unk> on to smoke started , but with <unk> , to then finally , <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue to follow and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
what he says us that ?
not , cigarettes , healthy .
but it says us , aging , very complicated is , and that we need clean statistics , we need an easy at the systems and we need to simple questions .
ai n't very simple question , and a very simple issue , in different countries , preserved , is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it 's now .
that 's the testosterone , <unk> so , in the male <unk> produced .
and there 's <unk> very simple evidence for <unk> men will , as old women .
you can now everybody for , think , if that 's a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free land .
but it come still better tips , not afraid .
that should we 've got correlation with this causality , to confuse this .
sounds complicated , but it 's just , the usual <unk> to illustrate .
there . so , ai <unk> grandma , and asks , what you have , because so different done or different eaten , so old become are ?
ah .
the she has every day , 10 of cigarettes , down .
that 's probably the secret of their ages , right ?
and have the ten cigarettes , maybe just not <unk> .
or , but they have <unk> and the she would be without the ten cigarettes , older .
even hard labor statistics are not always <unk> .
there for instance , ai n't very hard statistics , shows that people , the <unk> in the <unk> to get older , when people , that do n't .
do .
it would reproduceably put them .
is that , <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it it 's the people just enough money in the pocket have to , well , to her age and the <unk> of them to take care .
if i but a group of the lab , <unk> to forage maybe give and this group with 20 percent live longer than it ai to a group by the <unk> just ca n't get , but otherwise , exactly the same thought was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet by .
and actually are these are trying to have been done .
to tell you , the <unk> is very -- at , but even i do with my enemies , agree 'm is the twin fast that live life .
and that works for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see here , ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line , then life , the longer .
and the same for <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and recently was only ago about two years in the shown that , even for the monkey is true .
and let 's not about , skinny .
it also , <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's a another experiment , in the united states was done .
what , you did here ?
you , ai <unk> taken and has the a that so-called <unk> administered to a <unk> diet , where you so , <unk> here day and night , has .
and who cares about it , mice are wonderfully thick become , sick and have this ai n't very bad <unk> had and bad <unk> .
now , you ai in common with <unk> taken and the has the right in the same amount of <unk> looking at the only that somewhere in the ai n't break .
the have the day ca n't eat allowed , for you have at twice so much .
and this <unk> now is not have and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
though , both animals <unk> does .
both have the same as much .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens is really ?
it is a process called the cellular <unk> or <unk> on .
when , they were organisms , or stem cells replicating food taken away then start the organism , redundant ingredients in the cell or those compounds needed them to turn it again , energy .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , in the cell , it , <unk> and mainly we crashed , the ages <unk> .
the one then with the stomach , the compounds to <unk> and the cell as energy back to get asked .
it will just of the age , accumulate in the borders that .
that 's quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell .
so , to it so , twin fast at life that live in different organisms .
and it 's probably to take that 's also , people work .
and we learn from it , you just not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> the day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should , say , if you 're hungry , have , ah , maybe is just the <unk> on .
welcome you your hunger , like a friend .
and that makes it also <unk> sense .
while <unk> had nine nine percent of history has the human being what did , when he got hungry , had ?
alright , he 's and you 've gone .
we go out regularly , the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe against the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is , to , but the meat is weak .
the garden like for us very different from .
here , of <unk> <unk> in a medieval the garden that .
the three guys here 's good , the food , all day , let , too .
and that 's kind of the <unk> .
we therefore on the looking after all made the molecular answer the <unk> turn , although the organism .
that could for people to be very interesting , whose <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might , one of the hardest <unk> of life to preserve .
the question is so we can the <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds , the thousands of all on the natural substances .
we have in the fact , found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , in all of organisms , naturally is said , but also in all of organisms , during the halt even less will .
in the skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been the less <unk> in the skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells to give the example , then you see here .
that 's an ai is through the cell .
this is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> it , and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the empty room , the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were very well , look .
and that works in different organisms .
here for instance , shown in <unk> .
so we ai substance , the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life , because the organisms , so , no longer .
and the answer is again , you see here , ai typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , of days is about half the dead .
when , we <unk> into water to be here in actually be the animals grow older and survive better .
we also know , human cells , we of <unk> ex vivo <unk> have in culture , about three , for survival , if we do you with <unk> put themselves .
and the latest research on top , too close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> life .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you want to say , all know , where it comes <unk> ago ?
how the name , says , it 's the sperm being discovered been , but it comes in very high concentrations .
but i can they did , in <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms that cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , in japan , <unk> firstly , that 's <unk> <unk> come very much <unk> ago .
we then , if <unk> against <unk> helps to it , 4.5 <unk> it then you may also , <unk> ?
they have to find is to know , the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we have in the did experiments that .
they 're going to wonder , we have the , flies .
that will see , a forgetful memory , if you old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you old .
and the molecular mechanisms , that are areas of these are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , how to the devil has the guy , the memory of flies of ?
this is the experiment , what we put together with stefan seals out of college in berlin who have made .
you take a fruit flies and put the here 's a picture , where a target smell , they love .
<unk> .
and let the , in this <unk> <unk> .
then they take the same fly to give you in the next chamber , and give them <unk> other smell , they love , which <unk> .
we do you the <unk> enjoy , but if you ai <unk> <unk> .
the classic <unk> .
then take you back the same fly to do the here in .
the drive here 's degree in the <unk> down , there you the .
and if you down here , got 're going to give you , a side <unk> and of other side <unk> .
where you go all , to go ?
right .
to <unk> .
except the two here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i let 's ' i 'm not by so this ai <unk> reward being corrupt .
okay .
this is , but it ai n't form of character , with the age increases .
not only at flying .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , at the back to .
and the <unk> , in the brain that were , were back the ground .
that is , <unk> does n't just , aging , but also , <unk> diseases , maybe some .
and that 's important , because we want yes , the <unk> not the span of a se kidding .
it does n't make sense , the time the <unk> to prolong life .
and i want you do n't get them , without them , a few practical , tips , to do we we have a younger .
, <unk> fast .
it 's not about , you weight reduced , or something .
there 's the way now in austria ai group of <unk> people , a day to eat and a day ca n't eat .
this is the way that so-called <unk> under the line of <unk> ludwig and by erwin <unk> .
and the keep the very good pilot .
that is , it 's <unk> .
that they <unk> .
it 's not to carbs , complex , carbs , seem to do n't be dangerous . .
it 's really to take candy .
you know now , <unk> burst out there are to get diabetes in their own , even then if you 've got sleek .
and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors , go .
here you ai <unk> , the ago , to all ages .
after 30 days are the all dead .
very low doses of glucose rich .
to a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , that works in almost all of organisms that .
food they routinely out-performing the fruits and vegetables .
that you the gift of to a lot <unk> or of <unk> all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer in a way .
that is not under the circumstances for them vitamin d .
we 're here maybe some degrees ' in a <unk> , because vitamin d is dominated by sunlight on the skin , educated .
some , you least three times per week , ai half hour , sports , that 's completely trivial .
and cigarettes , despite the bet <unk> examples of you <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do you in times the eternal <unk> occasionally the quiet .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is the opposite .
because the monks of life , so long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> life is still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die from earlier than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume , that has what do with some really all business .
no way , no way , that 's very simple .
if now here 's a <unk> the window is then this plaster ' i the with <unk> <unk> solution .
and what 's like that 's probably in her around .
<unk> them , <unk> and so what , by drinking under the circumstances , there <unk> .
so , alcohol , ai <unk> effect .
a permanent partner , or ai family , longevity is associated with .
they should n't , a lot of the busiest street .
now you think the same <unk> .
that , but with <unk> n't have to do .
it 's going to <unk> .
you can measure the closer to someone , a lot of the busiest street who lives , the more <unk> , in the blood .
and that again , when he says , i was time you 're used .
i can already well , and the noise that makes me anything from .
not true .
he has yet , more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
the sunlight that should be so , because <unk> course .
we know now , <unk> very good metabolic effects .
all , it can the <unk> down .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice , against the infectious to protect .
knew that way our grandmothers will also , the us with <unk> and so <unk> .
it 's not without any sense .
several charities that will give the dark chocolate , dementia <unk> , can .
just recently is a study <unk> , has shown that there ai for half the board of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> one <unk> on the level of <unk> get you can .
anything with suspected that you of coffee , here is the data at but it thinner .
there 's studies , that show , there 's studies , that 's not show .
what 's clear , is , coffee against juvenile diabetes <unk> it and their metabolic performance better .
and the coffee is the way , a good <unk> because he solves <unk> , how we put together with <unk> <unk> of paris to show you could .
ai n't very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people to fifteen years for the study were have shown to people , every day , ai handful of nuts to eat their <unk> to 20 percent down .
that 's a huge value for this ai <unk> study .
and that is for almonds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for the peanuts , the <unk> 've actually , beans .
the give just , by , you nuts to call , okay .
that are , but actually , beans .
so for the peanuts , is the world .
the next thing is a little bit .
that you the tape of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
ai n't very beautiful new study shows you to , if you in this time to a lot of animal protein to , they take her <unk> so strong , increase , as if you a strong smokers , be .
that is not for the time , where the animal protein that are good and it 's true of course not for <unk> children or who on the animal protein need and it is not for pregnant and that , it will want .
in general that they <unk> .
what that they do , you staying <unk> know that , friedrich nietzsche along , has said , the objection to the <unk> , that a happy , mistrust the <unk> are signs of health .
all <unk> heard in the pathology labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after this regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old .
he comes from my home <unk> of the <unk> , is never get sick .
and he 's very good .
he 's just not <unk> as well , not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's particularly of healthy <unk> there .
he has about the <unk> followed , i do you today i said .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments , ai n't important fact , not only overlook .
which is the <unk> the halt me , in not organic , but a social seems to be , and so , a psychological .
you <unk> the old people less , and that could one of the <unk> mistake of our culture .
<unk> wrote the novel , the <unk> a year ago , his death .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece , the contemporary of critics , the adolescents , fresh <unk> .
i thank you for listening .
i want to start with a question , i 'm going to the house .
a question , where now , no up to , because the is a little <unk> which of you who 's very ?
the output , this is very low .
one are still as i thought .
it , but probably the reasons , why do n't who have , also the people that for instance , which is quite <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
and this is that does n't even the case .
will see one is actually more like a phenomenon , people as to be alone .
maybe that 's it also , that do n't who have , because the question , fuzzy , put this is .
you , lonely , or is you very ?
you can , lonely feel anything , lonely .
and you can be lonely , without , in the moment lonely .
one has also a lot with a shame .
also that is some now here from have , and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness that in a shame and shame , in one .
one takes time .
also why is , now here , nobody who have in the few seconds , where you -- i gave .
and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness to the time to , of all aware .
and loneliness to also practice , to talk about .
and this exercise we actually have one time .
we have neither the language , we sign for us , to recognize when we are lonely ?
there 's the one two <unk> , where i , a bit .
the a part of man says , you is of the beginning , lonely .
of the birth to death is you just really lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go then , to <unk> and drive , the whole day .
i ' no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there 's people might be less country , say , everything is with everything connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i 's just a part of the universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also am the time , , thinking .
the thinking , okay , today i a lonely and the next day , oh , it depends on , all together .
if we , and loneliness to think drops for us , first of the very big one , a .
the one of dying , the one of the person on one of intensive care .
but about this <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' i now do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , about the everyday <unk> , where one of us , so a theater to face .
i also do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> the <unk> .
one in other to realize it falls , we usually not difficult one at us to <unk> already .
the photographer and christine , tailors , the break a few pictures made , i show you want .
how easy it gives us , falls , at the other and loneliness to .
and we all know , not , whether these people , really in the moment lonely she felt .
but who knows it 's not the moment , so <unk> event , where you think , all talk together , you itself is something lost in the corner and has anybody to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know the safe here all .
may have some they also now , experienced .
what you about what you do that cell phone out very often , that could you today , very good to see that 's doing , that <unk> on the mobile , and escape , the <unk> .
the visible , if you on the display , look .
what we now here do n't .
yes , and then there 's the one , the degrees , you sitting on the one of <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces ago , and you even something left in the hope , you , text , not forget .
these are the <unk> , you , though .
the we other people on .
but i 'm sure , there 's here , people in the room , of birth , lonely feel the her entire life for so he spent have , have tried to this one of , <unk> , to distract yourself .
and there 's in this room , guaranteed , people the lonely , are , because they 're on a other people up to was it because of death or because of a separation .
there 's using it also have nothing , still so many people , people , they 're connected to stand around you are you feel , lonely .
and there 's people , have the terms to , lost find no contact with more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , you 'll the analog loneliness .
the analog loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people , after their , there 's no , social contact .
also that 's always be relatively .
there 's not a kind of the number , not an arbitrary number , whenever somebody to human contact , when i do n't .
we falls out there , the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but all in cities , connected with very many people at facebook or a twitter or facebook is this digital one always gets bigger .
you can with hundreds of people to be anything , with a single people really connected to be .
it 's the analog one more like the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital and loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often the other <unk> .
that 's also , that the analog one of a little grew in .
whereas the digital one , good place for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's kind of this point that the digital loneliness to the future , they gain is when the ways , connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years that feeling that the our of loneliness is very similar to that is , and loneliness to call it will .
or whether you for and then a new word for you .
but that are also , the problems with the successional generation .
almost more than the one of itself is the fear , of loneliness and from this fear , the one are people have a little to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , also a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the root wolpe describes as you , which people do everything to do n't want to be alone .
they build cathedrals , the children , then again , are feeling lonely and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you went on the fear , of loneliness to kick out , which is to spend money .
and shop to go .
things that 's favor .
both the process over , the one , because it at least in short run a stick with that , the objects themselves , you that has .
only problem is that 's very short , help and holding , this one of those potions for the one .
so we need to , new things to buy us new <unk> .
i ' time watching the for a a <unk> panties label .
and the <unk> , very , <unk> of your communications , with the slogan be doing all of it .
what this at the panties has to do , you know , not , but it works , that .
one has so anything with the <unk> to do loneliness to find under the people , instead .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse , but the worst is the loneliness to <unk> .
hand on it 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to be or the or the other the brushing her to see and , suddenly an awful , just to feel , awful , lonely having to feel and the question to ask , who is this person actually ?
i did , i have , even something to do ?
a study that , the most lonely and women , its , married , with kids , feel .
of missing , because i 've now , not more you know , if i the study , even invented have so often . i ' i they told .
but it 's also now , no matter because it at least in studies , mostly care is , and the response , the same is that the people , i <unk> .
that intuitive , so completely of course is , almost , a <unk> .
and loneliness to <unk> is any given too , and yet we talk , not about you .
talk , little bit about the one the sex .
also that has probably already , experienced .
now , while you <unk> is , suddenly to think , what do , i 'm here 's really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
also that a form of loneliness to the not what to have to deal with the quality of sexual are about .
also have nothing to do have to deal with the quality of relationship .
they just is always there .
we speak only do n't about you , because we do n't you look .
we speak only , not about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the one , <unk> as we think .
i stood <unk> on that <unk> <unk> and i 've seen a group of five <unk> , better , three the suit and two people carrying costume either .
the two men have , entertain the two women in a costume designers have , a conversation .
and in between what was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in the hand of an intern .
i think , i have to you the scene n't get out on with you this shape of loneliness that everybody 's also have time in his the fabric has experienced , again <unk> can .
it 's the one of <unk> .
it 's but also the one of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , sit here might also some of tricking her life looking at <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in become bars , often , do n't know more , who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
also that 's a form of loneliness to tell you the not talking about how will .
just so it 's also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> to misuse .
down here is insulation .
i did , <unk> told me , and he 'd been of a client , and the has said , it 's what , then , this happens , you can do it you ca n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so , to itself , <unk> guy .
and two months later he 's also have stepped down .
the one never comes alone so .
they come , in conjunction with other feelings .
well , beautiful siblings , and ugly , sibling .
the ugly siblings , we all .
fear , sadness in despair , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings , not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea for you look , and loneliness .
and come about in life like the tide , and a flood .
let you going to and let you do n't of you take .
because there 's still something much worse than the loneliness and this is the empty , maybe one after the one comes when you do n't know , sensation .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard about one thought i have , for me two things .
one thing , in my immediate the <unk> i do n't even more like a more autocratic dictator since i realized i did that i just mix , who 'd have why he , not in and because i was thinking maybe a recording i the people , might wind ' i lonely .
i think about it 's been able , since i the one in my life accepted to have people come and go to happen .
well , about the <unk> , you that power .
also there i free .
people come and go to let , they do n't even more immediately , and the votes , from a close encounter a friendship , or at a partnership have the could .
as a child i found my parents were incredibly embarrassing .
the can , any <unk> by , without with somebody a conversation with anybody .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led to see it will talking .
as a child i found that as i said , embarrassing .
as young adult , i know they 're incredibly for <unk> that to can this openness to have .
but just since i even , one too have to make it me at least , and again , i was also <unk> so to open .
you see it 's very be called , willing to do for the performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i , here three seem that .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now , like , i mean , if you just once we are then what kind of make-believe , they would take ?
the most of you , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least of effort on the effect in .
at health , we doing this kind of different .
there we let the activity with the biggest impact on , except for eight and to us for other strategy .
we 're going to us , for example , <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we 're going to us for the <unk> .
the is for diet .
also very big <unk> but still very big effort .
for me that 's also not so valuable .
and i want you today about how you with the least of effort the biggest <unk> produce .
if you , with the prevention and health , too , you going to a topic , not a drum from around .
and the issue is overweight .
and the theme of obesity , was in germany over time , no issue , about to the <unk> .
and then went from the number of obese people in germany and strong .
and i asked me , there was going on the <unk> ?
why was that soar , to go up ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> .
because it was exactly the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> , germany .
and we 're going over and along ?
and i went on at .
<unk> comes running , germany .
and that obesity , up .
and the years <unk> take the rate , right , and draw on .
and what 's coming then , germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how does this means .
and we 're going over and along ?
well , i was one , and one was cleared out .
because it was yeah .
sports , thick .
and of stuck , i 'm not here today , to say , sports , thick .
because that 's not true .
but one , we now in volunteerism that .
the tide of always a new thought -- and <unk> has not that led , we are thinner and you’re going .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and also there 's the ai n't very great study from the united states .
also the have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to briefly , we look , what happened there really ?
and they have seen the people take in fact , less fat on , but the people take that less calories on , but anyway , along .
and that was the paradox .
and so you have it <unk> challenges .
we can you explain that ?
there to do the body like a power to imagine .
there we have here , ai , <unk> .
and the a side to come from a <unk> , i do we all the coals on the be here is burned .
and here is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , more coals on here in to be in our power as we the other side that use <unk> , the energy in the power and it makes it took off .
the human body does n't the same way off .
the can the energy to store .
and it in terms of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we have less like we have heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here the energy and then it 's just a conclusion to .
the <unk> , to drastically reduces .
here you do n't live more than it .
we 're yes , only still up .
and exactly that 's happening .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 kilometers to walk a fluke .
and we come today is an even on a to two miles and are the positive , that .
there 's studies , the report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> , you that still something <unk> with my friend mike tell .
give you me degrees ' the chair ?
mike , come you degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's too shy , he 's not going to talk too much .
and he was at this trial , and sitting now here .
he 's this typical southerners <unk> , jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike , eats , less and , less and takes only still <unk> , and yet , he and over and along .
why ?
because it 's mike 's only still sitting .
and i was time i watched , how much , mike , the day , and i told him , a step counter the back in the bag will put them and at night i went back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
that was so the distance , mike , at has the morning , from the kitchen , the car with the car into the office there , a coffee , get and night coming back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
it means that mike was , day , 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and its minutes i was mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions of disease of america alone .
and mike 's not going and dick , because he to be much eating , because so long , he goes up , energy <unk> , but not waste of he will inevitably , along and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> , the energy , you see here , his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , that 's not there .
the <unk> , eventually , back in <unk> blood .
and also there is they were active and <unk> still , and quiet , his <unk> .
so the sugar .
so if , the energy <unk> the blood , you 're talking about the physicians of high blood and high <unk> .
and this blood sugar , the <unk> there 's like <unk> , all little black holes in this <unk> .
and a lucky you 're there 's still throughout the fat around and that up , well , these little nasty wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now to he the blood flowed through these tight <unk> pots pumps and we speak of high .
and if this high , then on a <unk> true , then makes it 's also in the body breaks off .
and if that the heart was happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if it in the head happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany and dies every second , heart and the stroke .
that is , in germany and dies every second , <unk> .
and also mike , so not so sick , because he does n't like sports , drives , but because he , does n't even more than moving .
and if you this across n't know , for you always , the wrong .
for the subject of diet .
i have degrees ' `` yesterday , diet , amazon , being and get there environment , <unk> <unk> <unk> , now .
and if each book , so just a centimeter is thick and we would the here <unk> , if we have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there is inside and now that 's really important if you more energy to take and so more food as they consume and then you will be thick .
and if you less energy to take and when they consume and then you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to the environment , books ?
that makes just a conclusion to .
that need of course , is huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why it fails , a diet , to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what this from the things , we here , three weeks to make and here , five weeks , if we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our normal lifestyle .
what does that then , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .
except <unk> and again , <unk> in the confidence , again , we 're not that have made , what we 've correctly .
so you allowed to go from here today , every new diet , at every new <unk> questions , and you want that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle , into .
yes or no ?
and if yes , then go .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because if the end of anything out , it is that time .
it are the habits , about to decide whether we 're sick , or stay healthy .
it are the bad habits , sick .
and it are the good behavior , the us healthy .
and if mike , in the mirror at then he look , the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror at , then he look there , everyday habits .
and if mike , in the mirror at and honest , to , is , you see he also , where he comes along .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good , then he is that , disease , along .
and if mike , in the direction to the health direction of its goals , moving its dreams , then to he did n't immediately be whole life to change .
then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and a <unk> habits and mike 's also a great example of that that the person , a weird animal is .
mike , it for example , did , movement , from his life <unk> by he every way with the car <unk> of an uses , every lift , using .
and the evening on and he <unk> the couch and to somehow tying themselves , movement to come .
so , he , in his <unk> <unk> the gym . there with the an to go up what yes , by se , this is , and then how so this ai rat , again on a band <unk> , so he somehow , movement .
and my grandpa , it , just as any of how you .
the was a farmer and the have that did n't understand .
the have said , sport is for people the , not move .
and somehow , also , right .
why we need to night in our most precious time , that effectively compensate for what we the ground forgot to have ?
being taken , we have today in <unk> lifestyle , two hours of sports can make a day .
and about , but very much easier to the back there to find where we do you lose .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i do you today to a different perspective invite you .
may also know , the situation , you drive the evening , quickly , shopping and following , in the front row no place for free .
and that you look like , so in this <unk> in us .
we 're always the shortest because they go .
we plan our apartments , so that we the <unk> ways .
we plan our whole life , that we the <unk> ways , but that leads us , but not there , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so you allowed . ab now the <unk> activate and the back there find , where they 've been up .
i look out , like to the track .
and i 'm the only , always waking up and down and up and down there 's now , and all other .
but if i yet , time , i 'm then <unk> ' i but the time for me .
then <unk> ' i but the movement is a , there 's just so this around the ways .
and if the top of the <unk> comes to 30 minutes , so , say , i hooray .
environment , steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes , translated it .
and a <unk> environment , steps , if you go from here today , every day environment , steps more to go then that mean , the day , twelve gram of fat , not in your body record .
that may relatively little sound .
but as <unk> , as a habit of the time <unk> days , then we talk from four point five pounds of fat .
the we 're not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time this , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are yes crazy , imagine that what here .
that 's a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are one . ' i four pounds .
just so you time you see , what happened there with these little baby steps .
and if that the effect is of this perspective , what my you , just happened , if you really in an active life to start .
and this <unk> the bring you go from here today , every day in their day-to-day .
once you , <unk> steps per day , got 're going to walk you virtually all <unk> .
and if you feel like , and i have time on the sports and then they do that on top .
then you have to the <unk> also still <unk> .
then you will also , and stronger .
but to do you your health , not more on the amount of sports .
so they make your health , not more on the amount of like it , and of their time .
because the critical , the that they do now , every day as a lifestyle .
and i <unk> ' a active lifestyle <unk> .
and for me , it 's now more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based on for the lives and for me .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do , or do have .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now only one more idea for them .
you decide , ab now just , for the best .
and ab now you can also how can .
step for one step .
thank you .
<unk> how it has a leonardo , da vinci , actually managed , so incredible , you see , in the world with other eyes to see ?
and , so far on the <unk> what to his time just simply inconceivable , unless it was right ?
we could do this also now ?
that , maybe what do with companies to do ?
and how we can make of power and confidence for our future to draw ?
we start , but the time , with the question what we understand , under the innovation ?
right .
technology and invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the <unk> the federal government .
now , i was right .
that is yes , all great .
and we can with quite proud to be and be grateful that we <unk> in such a lot of the fields are that our technologies around the world to be that 's us well , about .
that we do with a so extraordinary , unique , wealth have evolved .
but look like it with the future of ?
the challenges , because there as a society based on us to ?
and who cares about , because there to the ecological and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> , it that somehow , to be .
a kind of division .
so the care , the ecological challenges , because the entrepreneurs and then the big effort , we then productivity and efficiency .
and the the world better want to make the find , nonprofit organizations and bring together and citizens and the need to actually , what companies , so if you 're <unk> course , then the damage the term capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least , very complex to fix .
but who says , because that we all that as well , separated at to ?
how would it because if we <unk> , ai social and cultural dimension to expand this ?
if technological innovation in the same time , cultural innovation are ?
if economic vitality out of the same time , social innovation are ?
if it gives us from ever leaders , thinking and doing to self-assemble with the solution has a environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different way they have an unknown , these <unk> and if it gives us even though , , and fair <unk> of forward ?
because how was that ?
both sides to help but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask you may come .
so far we that yes , as a way .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh is incredibly much does the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more just in direct <unk> to the what the government <unk> job .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i realized that the nobel <unk> .
the opportunity , drops to me , i <unk> , they still with anyone familiar .
allow , i imagine <unk> <unk> .
'n . it implication of young guy .
great , trained , which , but also , ideal parent from capsizing .
and yes , so , <unk> .
i like the , like .
and if you the see , then you think , oh really , the offspring , we need to us to our future , you do n't worry .
yes , the same , after the studying , then here somewhere started to work at a our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that does he also very good .
that they like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something is there 's still so in him .
so he asks , there 's not be more , that somehow , i would be there ?
so this the entrepreneurial , he says , .
companies are yes , in all <unk> .
and like that he also .
and he had fallen , this <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , so , which is the same recognized .
so not that he puts it personally , if you know , but the <unk> says he the , what .
and there was in the middle of the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so , the more , he was surprised when the him , then the <unk> personally was introduced .
as mister <unk> .
and as 'n an entrepreneur , , then there imagined .
the 's great pleasure troubling , so with young people together , there , his experience both .
and the two , then you line .
and have , more .
how would it because if we now , in a lot of those of the two time <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how was that because again , right .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> by companies ?
that i still not so , understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , but the time , the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says it 's `` yes .
were markets , established products , established business customers , established structures , there 's a <unk> .
and you can also pretty much exactly the quest . ab : give , where the big one is causing .
and time , ai ai <unk> , the very neat is , that again .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> , so one , it 's time n't guarantee it 's exactly what 's not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has yes , a completely other character .
because it has , nothing <unk> .
not by customer , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of why is a <unk> a temporary organization , the purpose to serve a business to go , to find to the impact is , of course , but , would reproduceably put it 's and then we scale it .
and you 'll be safe to understand that , of course , so <unk> organization , another very different kind of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , that 's me , very clear .
but after what we look for because actually ?
so , i <unk> ' time , then let 's , there 's drum as <unk> <unk> to make money or ?
so i , there 's also a degree , that fits very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin , you want to me that recommendation here ?
that means <unk> .
how you your businesses , <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> did .
oh no .
really <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning -- over your <unk> money did what 's because after your <unk> ?
so start loving you then a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what if you with your commitment , i know you ?
and also we look , but , <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are very few years , then in a much worse , financial situation ago when your great .
money is always the result of a successful company , and one good at the community-led company .
now , you money is a power for fundraising enterprise actions .
and it is the foundation all economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is then the goal ?
the company ?
so , when i do within . ' i , but i learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , to have yet , and measurable in time . we could be , and so forth .
and when i think that all right there 's not . i , so that 's like , for something of the i do n't know what i look for me to do ?
so that makes me do n't feel good .
so how do i because there 'll decide , and risks to take that feels , for me all so you know , and inherently uncertain .
yes , <unk> welcome the enterprise .
but i , there may what for you .
a thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so almost , secret .
and <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how he says , you today ?
<unk> one . ' i , <unk> ?
so we say , always <unk> .
, for the crises and <unk> and <unk> of uncertainty .
so help save them .
i think , i can you a lot of them to leave .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there are yes , just ask it .
that can you the same time you a the are hugely qualities that 's good questions to imagine .
we in the time , after the other through , they said , perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want to do ?
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> what moves you that about you down , that 's bigger than you itself ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you are willing to be ?
what are your inner , perhaps , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why does that important to be able to see ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this , learn ?
if you a ship to do to then <unk> not the men together bits of work a hot , wood to collect , but i teach you , sort after the of africa , it 's an ocean .
yes , well .
so then i look , i time to me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , <unk> now , do you your goal really time give me .
actually give me in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you 'll ago , if you <unk> , what you do n't want to then it will , you hang them stay .
you know , the story with the pink and elephants ?
it 'll give me , there 's degree .
not ?
<unk> .
so , pass time on .
reset you time , no turning pink and elephants .
okay ?
it does it , right ?
so no turning pink and elephants .
understand ?
no turning pink and elephants .
you see ?
so let 's us , if we were so on to focus on that , what we do n't want .
what is there 's actually the only way ?
there 's about <unk> ?
yes , displace it , you that ago , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the baby pandas the <unk> .
but we displace it you think about ago .
the way , what i just one thing you like , <unk> right ?
i , you , there , with them .
look over time , if you <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this room <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i is what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i is what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .
oh , but you ♫ but <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?
madam , as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you one <unk> adversity do <unk> <unk> may is out .
<unk> from <unk> .
it 's just a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and <unk> like it comes from ?
you what i noticed ?
which , something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower here .
okay .
so , then we can look , but the time , then , let 's where the bear of them .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this room <unk> lord smith .
who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i is what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i is what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .
and <unk> , let 's you that ?
so , i still , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first time , i did .
i thought it can yes , not was to be .
and still much more shocking , i was as me through the head , is it might be that i really all the time , by the area over ?
by my life .
and okay , i mean , that makes yes , meaning .
to come up there , the immediate <unk> to prevent that we the most of our perception and our <unk> 'll <unk> to .
but what 's because now , this ?
what <unk> ' i was and what <unk> ' i from ?
and so <unk> , among you your perception and somewhere <unk> to tell , is this ai n't even more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thank you , then we get , but the time to the next question .
how i could actually to my goal to come ?
so , i find that this ai n't good question .
that 's like , i which every time , and i know that somehow not on going forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's it ai n't good news for you .
that you get to fall when you may have used to know what did .
because if you your what 's clear , your inner drive and if you 'n ' in fact is very rough metaphor also presented so what did i promise you , is it going back inside of happen by .
almost .
you do n't really differently , as that a brainstorming , you 're going to make things on you to give up .
that are then these famous <unk> , you get up under the shower , what did .
and , ai n't question i recommend you , the look , you , well , who you have them could who you to take an interesting questions could , there more input , more at with home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have that 's ourselves .
<unk> di <unk> , if the not more and you know , has the in his <unk> invited back in florence .
for lunch , the famous big table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , as engineers , architects and he has this ai n't very intense <unk> cared .
but not in our world today senses , where it 's drum , i see , yes , who , again , through ?
who has been right ?
but rather than to that of these different <unk> things that are the so on any kind and in one of them alone could have to come up .
well , yes , the next question is what good concrete next step i do ?
<unk> there are doing , it was pretty successful entrepreneur in the reason .
instead , to plan , and management and so focusing on you , just in the next step .
because what do you , because in terms of uncertainty and also do ?
but the lead this very determined and with all the consequence of .
and if it 's and then nothing was well , dan , for you , <unk> other one step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's , ai other .
so it 's so important that you your what 's clear .
that there you the inside of security .
and the way , how we actually have all going to learn ?
although we that yes , do n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- and says , also <unk> at birmingham children .
so , this playful attempt to learn , this for , and this <unk> playful attempt for it 's also , the fun makes that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also , right , that <unk> against the uncertainty , otherwise , so anxious .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds like , yes , very great .
but i do n't know , at me in the company , i think , there to , still a lot of bosses change that there anything happens .
and myself for here in germany , there 's always been so these general ; mood .
and i think , there have the politicians , the first place for , that , to change .
okay my boy , come time with .
how to go here , down to the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look , the time here .
and if you see ?
alright , the .
this is the the you change can , you really change can .
or to it , mahatma gandhi believed to say , for the change , you in the world , looking in you .
you think , beautiful words and big models , but how do that because it work ?
there , we , still 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all <unk> of crisis , or if you to small , you feel for something or if you a famished <unk> and they have all with you to do .
and if you do in one of situations ask what to you now despite all this to ask , you , which posture , you take you can physically , you very powerful .
it 's like , you , but the time , what you , them like , about the you just <unk> .
and , finally , to ask , you , what you actually sort of this crisis , or the , what happened is because what did .
so i my , if it you already happening is , , it at least worth it has .
yes .
mister <unk> .
and you think really surprised to me that it on my enterprise way ?
yes , right .
and among you , two things .
first time the expression on the clarity of your inner <unk> , then to your enterprise for everyone .
because that determines your perception .
and second , the expression on your inner core of you even the street .
because so <unk> you like the other people , to you behave .
the future of always just then when we our own perception .
<unk> you that to ?
yes , i think , already .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what you think of our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it because now , with this <unk> ?
that 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
obvious .
which i , the spirit , i see .
<unk> is to breathe stir up .
and that is , what the <unk> really .
a <unk> from those potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
that 's but the <unk> .
the right now this country , long time in the big , the name <unk> .
from robert bosch , <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin -- or <unk> or how they all the hot .
let us , just that spirit , its mission .
and who knows , maybe is yes , from our <unk> the next leonardo of our time .
you see , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it was so intuitive , i with kids and their future i 'm concerned , because finally , are yes , children , our future .
instead is that the view , i of the time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , have my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , started .
we technically qualify <unk> entrepreneuring , that means you , after the later , either on doing , or find after their if i was lighter , in the workplace , they actually , can hold .
why would take care i now , so it turns out to <unk> , so the ones who are already have are the big mistake i have done ?
our program is a much not so easy to understand how to run the , care for children .
and honest , had said , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , i work would .
do you know , is the most critical lack of the childhood , with the people , where we work ?
we found out , it are positive models often the male positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often it 's because that the father 's no sensible work , that he as well , he drugs , consumes one or that he asked ourselves in prison is .
and if then a seven-year-old boy think about what he from his life to make , maybe not even better idea , like a different lives might look , because he was no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> , you , martin , imagine .
martin 's <unk> our program .
his father was an alcoholic drink and made the whole family that live in the hell .
when he was 12 signature was is his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother who had to the home .
there was he the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and so the perfect victims .
to the day when be a little baby brother , a game , so roughly <unk> been is that the bottom are truly remained .
there out , martin first time to the <unk> through , he went on the enemy , go and proposed to .
and go from this day he was respect .
and so it was never go .
violence was part of well , to his life is exactly like at his father .
how it 's now at the ones , i just described . i , next ?
after the childhood , the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> the perception .
and then you will one day with people into prison is closed , where it , is , their thoughts about the same over the also not a better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together , after , if you put together in prison in this ?
mostly about not much good .
and they will be better criminal justice in <unk> .
they sell and these drugs on a higher level , and plan , in the later , where you after the custody <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that is , in germany will everybody had second criminals are going .
then there 's but also people in prison , really change , you .
but also , these people wear a rubber stamps in the broad forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that their first identity .
if you know , a work for , if you an apartment for whether they new private build a relationship to all you going with this identity , with that rubber stamps confronted the heat them , who in the society so it 's hard power .
this is the problem , ago , we look .
how we 're trying to this problem to solve ?
what they have this , you think , to many <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
it are more entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> , who has definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> has a 's a little <unk> , otherwise something , he 's not in prison , did .
these characteristics we 've set for something good use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three on .
we give the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everybody in order to write its own <unk> and everybody , in getting <unk> part .
and then you 'll we the people , after the custody at the <unk> , <unk> the strengthening of your personal relations and also , one of <unk> .
what for a big go there from our program , and out ?
it 's a great range , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> , <unk> .
a very big , bandwidth and to <unk> ' i just like to <unk> imagine .
<unk> leaders , talent and his illusion , is money to have him , very early , trade with the cocaine seduces us .
he had always been fun , businesses to do .
he 's then <unk> first time to arrested .
and this later , it 's not particularly am impressed me .
now , the point .
he says , ourselves now , he have looked at his second later prepared .
<unk> is he then the second time of hiv/aids .
and he then only in therapy , and then the <unk> .
and there i learned when he 'd like he would be the leaders , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 had let 's been , then october <unk> his agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's well , he can now of life .
he , very good <unk> joking .
he 's now here with me .
who him to meet each other to talk about it .
, back to martin that i told him to start telling had .
martin , after his childhood a training to the vectors of and ended up in his time in the <unk> <unk> .
so , alcohol , and drugs , there , the agenda are was to cycle quite quickly started .
he worked in parallel when i just and as <unk> .
twenty years to he this life .
and he says , today , he was visiting with this fabulous lifestyle to do n't own consciousness <unk> .
one day , bruised , he did anyone in <unk> so hard that he then he convicted .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there has really be life changed .
he learned , he to more force to more success and to more life could come up without his <unk> to make juice or without drugs to consume .
and he was of his arms — so excited that he had decided this to he likes to pass .
and he wanted part of the <unk> be .
that has did .
he works for now , two years at us and <unk> our participants on their way , freedom , because he knows ourselves that , if you really change to , and if you have the right tools with , the hand , get that much more possible is when you often when i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people like you .
people , with us into prison , the to external events , with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , at your personal plans to help consult .
that are our authority , the <unk> talks in our lessons to keep , that are students at the <unk> do , <unk> the begin to drive .
and that are our mentors , our participants , right after the later to be with .
and also these people take a very much of our program with .
one example .
we do on our events , a practice , <unk> .
we stick and then in the middle of space a great resilience and our participants are the , and our an stand on the other side .
and i then in terms of questions .
and every time , if someone in space , this question , yes , answered of he , the line .
and here shows , what we all have that , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of that , where the differences are , is following question .
i 'm in a call social focal point up , i had a family , what , once in custody .
there are usually very many of our participants in front , the line and just very few of an environment .
a question , i 'd like the house , all together , the <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
to please , you that they all , up .
maybe we had a little light , in the audience .
i can you see .
it are all .
well .
thank you .
i get through , you now a question , and if you this question , yes answer to do again , , otherwise would remain they just stand .
that 's sort of our our line , we now .
i have in my life of illegal things done , for the i would be punished , can be it was , but not .
if you this question , yes answer to do you please .
to count , drunk all the risks .
to count , perhaps , too low doses of going into my obsession .
to count , it with the seat , not very , taken .
okay .
and it 's also used to help you may have any workforce , not always very accurate signed .
all right .
the most people in this .
we have a couple of the angel in space .
that 's wonderful , i 'm happy .
thank you , they 're allowed , all back down .
at this question , if we the the events , imagine , get our an very often the mulling stage .
and you will also , how much greater happiness , you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , in the they were growing up , with the friends , but also very lucky , that you may not always , engaged all been are if you something by the <unk> or , beyond this , have done .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their if i was a work .
that 's very quickly .
<unk> percent have , already taken independently .
a third of the donor cycles in the past year , <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i had it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent of the street .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , taxpayers <unk> dollars .
and it 's a <unk> , she what a <unk> of seven percent , a <unk> , usually <unk> percent for a massive saving it means .
when my father and i got together that <unk> , have , we 're open , first group of pretty much for quite nuts thought .
i was my amazing <unk> in a big businesses comes up .
but i must tell you , i in my life , not so a <unk> the work .
we encourage our participants consent to take responsibility to take .
responsibility , in your life 's happened , and , responsibility for to take , in their lives will happen .
, not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new consumer confidence and what it 's also the number , again , trust to build .
and so it makes me , especially happy and pride and when our participants , frankly , of their way to tell us .
here ; i did you a video with them .
film .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months convicted .
i began with going into it .
so , i judgment of two years , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my whole life changed .
and what for me was important , was this <unk> , also made .
because there was my , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , '' `` i almost to say , yeah .
i 've got back goals , eyes , she .
i 've got back into perspective , i 've got back to jump forward at .
and you about with a very other minds and confidence from the custody out .
so far it was always more <unk> without a fixed set goals and then is you , in and anything <unk> .
with the wrong people together and that now .
well , the problem is , many , no assistance systems have the emerge .
that the biggest problem , because then it 's automatically , which , you go back in the old , backward .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , no matter , there 's all of the time is , at me just all my thinking about me remind ourselves , about other , about the interacting with problems , about the interacting with the society , that , at me just as these two weeks , completely around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and been happening internationally , six months . bye . ' i went back with her .
so that means , we have a new relationship .
and because i sit under things , through this whole <unk> and many other things that changed . i .
so much . i ' i already done .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my at , '' `` i say .
i do , just a <unk> , <unk> .
you have to that really recognize that , very , many people are the fact , , for example of my now , about this time still out and actually about to be , i do n't know , <unk> is beyond the people .
i 'm grateful for you to the idea of all come are , so what do .
i 'm grateful for you to do it , despite with safety of difficulty was pulled have and i 'm extremely grateful , i would be part of having me .
that are some of course , the people , the support , and were .
i like i said , with many people at the events , talked , and the me , confirmed have that 's good , that do .
and it 's wind ' i 's also do .
and that would say , i thank you .
they come up with us in jail .
each of them has something , what we can .
if you our participants in their <unk> which , if you know when the <unk> to us to see if you in the frame of financial support , are .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> want to wear , <unk> issue .
talk , please .
martin <unk> and i are here today .
and i got to us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i , <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time , i do something that way .
there is that makes you yes , these things .
, for <unk> that .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .
there 's yes , really of possibilities like you with <unk> deal .
or how you <unk> deal .
anyway , i was <unk> also a way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i 'm here 's really kind of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i could tell me , right now , me charts like my life in 10 or two , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and this predictability and i did scary .
now , it at least , express .
, i had an adult <unk> crisis .
for themselves as private .
i knew just not going to the <unk> to go ?
do it me just really ?
or what if i mean <unk> again , i put it ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me .
that were so the thoughts .
i was in this time , free <unk> at a day .
like i said <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute at .
you fluently , free the world 's living in very good hotels and write fluently , the country on a very <unk> kind of the way .
fluently , but occasionally , <unk> countries .
the developing world where it 's safe , more to see , and say , there than about <unk> with villages kind <unk> local the , though they have nothing , so our happiness and joy of broadcast .
the kind of these images and from cliché , lives , but really chronicles a way too .
and exactly that was for me after a while the kicker .
i was that what i did to little bit .
to the surface .
and i found it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really did n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries , right to know .
to <unk> writing articles .
and to my personal interest to be breastfeeding .
how you learn arabic countries better know ?
by you with the people who lives .
the people who lives , at them home .
not in the hotel .
by you , with the challenges and with the problems of people .
and by you with the people who works .
at least was that the answer , i went on this question could be .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something worthy .
i wanted a contribution to afford .
something good .
and this sense , at me , at a <unk> . it increases .
i was , before , often in developing world , nepal , i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 year-old civil war , not just over and orphans , but also lots of economic and social problems and left .
the annual income of <unk> dollars , nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and it 's going to try to the two decades , the poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer from , malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult can do n't read and write .
all these are connected with , you very personal stories and experiences , i on this journey has had met me in a time , i was willing and frankly , was for change .
in the i even something to change .
and drum , and was after my return of nepal , my decision .
i quit my job .
and she took me at the aid .
and i <unk> , now , just an excerpt from the answer to return , i on my job application received .
because they just a defining who was .
it 's going to a serious application , <unk> international by a company .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the , degree of time in nepal want to live and a funding of living in .
hi ?
let 's still ?
i was really seriously , i mean , and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really do unplug .
and i did , in terms of course , a quite an emotional response , written .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead . i ' i do this , right to intense generation of being taken to what good <unk> to do .
i it 's used as an engine , to my own company to the reasons .
<unk> .
heart . labeled and soul <unk> .
a company that , exactly that offers , what i then for .
because the way , a country , to do .
the way , a country right to meet .
by i do with the people , and a life and you can work .
and that 's not anywhere can work , but in going <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in the two words , apart .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means much the place , the you good so karma , collect .
, the you do good .
that sounds now 'n little bit <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people , with us to afford a while their living their volunteering that .
they pay for their journey , at a other organizers .
but they travel , it works differently .
you live in <unk> .
and the main goal is n't care as a lot of recovery or as much <unk> but the real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we need .
to speak , our participants ever , qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work , gentle tourism , in areas and the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism have .
because just the infrastructure to get here 's missing .
the other we can send sustainable design projects and more .
we can own sustainable design projects to and finance .
we 're funded so to a hundred percent of itself .
are also not on giving wheelchair-bound .
and that 's just showing us for our long-term <unk> engagement of meaning .
started , we do with our work <unk> in nepal .
convenes a year we have our engagement , on uganda expanding .
and now after about four years , , we now i got married and my husband and i are also for a team was a <unk> question .
we go to the <unk> to continue ?
or what if we still hold greater than thinking ?
if we the <unk> . ca ?
if we do with the development is not just a social engagement and sustainable to in my but the development in its wholeness to measure ?
and so , the individual <unk> have them ?
or , from individual <unk> .
that would then , a new one extra company .
a company , that , company itself .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy , like <unk> .
we want that ?
i was the next question .
'n new software company ?
sure we want that .
we love social entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we 'll ticking .
because we the same language .
because we the same dreams dream .
because we the challenges to understand .
and why we 've done in a year <unk> a sister , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in of development and to <unk> the we by an extraordinary people .
to be with we the participants entrepreneur , or the staff of creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> other the <unk> which involved .
and <unk> the the <unk> prepare .
the there 's at <unk> also again .
a tour of the next to a meaningful <unk> still a whole other huge subject .
he shows a in relatively short time on where you this is , or where you <unk> .
where you may still unknown to communicate .
where you might want to a flexible , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good .
it leads to a his strength , eyes .
that 's the creativity , suddenly , great .
or that 's the serenity , you new in , discovered .
the serenity , taking the you ca n't we can change .
and the power , things to change , you can change .
and you very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
an example .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , named lydia and <unk> .
that are five very wonderful women from uganda .
with a sad <unk> and with a talent .
they would be a beautiful , was handcrafted <unk> for years .
and for years happened .
because they simply no market for it had .
because they do n't know , the quality can improve .
because you , nobody has said , which design may be in the question .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products of the people of poverty , get .
the you a income .
a future to occur .
we 're talking yesterday with our <unk> live gone .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sale to them not just for a year , income .
but allows us , the project , much bigger .
this first edition , is sort of social crowd <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who can support to , this , with the purchase a way to the other , he said , but with us , directly into the project to travel .
he can be able to the women and travel , active <unk> .
the long will we 're not only five women a work , but its or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , where we <unk> work .
and this is , but this <unk> just a project from our new integrated cycle , projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in just a region , just to little bit .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , .
everything , and in our own cycle on each other .
and the power to be more sense , as every project for yourself .
in place where we 've ever , qualification into the different projects .
the opportunities to have , mix , just in the joy of work .
and i 'm going to i do you now , right on a journey to take them .
and to please , you the eyes to close .
reset , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting in wooden dining room .
and you 're happy , and tired .
you just with your <unk> to had lunch .
there 's <unk> .

tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in here is it 's warm .
you <unk> of the window .
and see these kids on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet tumble through the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on them is a thin <unk> dust .
the children with laughter .
and out for fun to your name .
you <unk> you , you ca n't even more just <unk> .
<unk> .
you know , not the late , it 's .
but soon as you get up .
and the <unk> , the way that i still the kids were , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .
here you with lydia .
in the meadow , sitting in the shadow tree as you like the new designs of <unk> talk about .
like , you with my hands and feet to talk .
later come , the other women .

until you with your english to start .
under the tree .
in .
incredible , it here , the internet , there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
that <unk> you .
the exchange is every time value .
it 's also beautiful time again , german , to talk .
you 're hearing the music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> washing in the courtyard , the pots .
they sing an african proverb that song .
you are relaxed , and happy .
you 're doing the eyes peering back on .
each of us can the <unk> to meet , something new <unk> .
or at least for a short time the dice me again to look .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , interest me , whether of you today , tonight , they 're here , already time someone 'n ' house that has .
i just know , with the light that 's not really well , but perhaps want to someone woke up .
down here just know , i someone .
two .
here to go up just know , i unfortunately , not , but , down here are already time two , that 's beautiful , we 're already time to <unk> .
i ' , a building occupied and that the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
together with two other people . i ' i the villa out in the last summer , six months for that .
and so stuck , i now here tonight them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
what is a 's also ?
<unk> there 's `` yes , many .
but i want it just explain .
oh , what , you that now the villa along ?
and her <unk> then in park or how ?
just a small group selection of the questions we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you know you have , part of initiative , i whistle , which , something <unk> name , <unk> 'm .
all those , we reconnect seamlessly in the series of <unk> <unk> had .
and here , around these villa <unk> , had , <unk> common symbols and this banner of suspended .
and to the privatization of a villa out to stop protesting .
but who i know , i know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
that is a public space , the way that 's private which is , and so for many people do n't available to is , <unk> ' i do n't say , but just not in public hand is , and so that 's not be used can , public spaces may use .
we were a group of <unk> together in the desire , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable to deal .
and we wanted a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that i must now , just see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning , social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
now , the same time , with different social and cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and enriched .
and have us to , on different skills , but also on different social networks <unk> .
and creative in part unconventional solutions in the <unk> , then we did have , <unk> to realize .
we actually navigated to the villa out to occupy .
however , i see it gets us about that we the villa with stories and ideas that people .
we have to memories and images being asked .
and of these memories and images out to go of perspectives , a villa out to develop .
and it was telling us important that the process , constructively with .
us as an initiative , we have , always as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and emotional thing , and i was , and after to a <unk> .
the experiences , we , have made , <unk> ' i now that night , go .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face .
in many cases , this , privatized law and commercialized and be in the result of citizens , strangers are places .
they are the places in a city because you just a lot , not the equal , what we 're in a public space expect .
so , for that we <unk> have , <unk> .
now , this , but also the fact , public , the urban places from point , this will often did .
initiatives , the places like that would want to stay in many cases also <unk> interest , in the infancy .
what it has also with me to do , like here some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places to give our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in the our social life is happening .
so how we there are often the first <unk> that they to our neighbors , if we wanted to the way , you meet .
and we can this increase , if we just a ai n't have an opportunity , to sit , and we actually stop the spaces also designed accordingly that are .
and we just 'n live to converge .
it turns out of creating friendships , sometimes .
what but with safety of it 's a sense of community .
the more those who i , in that 's a public space . i , more and faster and more of that i also this community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , of that , what you probably the anonymous , a big city .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood up or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how can protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can only criticism in the ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism against the growing and actually also not much <unk> that the same places .
imagine if you now , they sit here , once , they beat the newspaper on and read the following the text .
i love to empower and citizens , we invite you a we want you three things varieties , redesigning the <unk> imagine the a before carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
they 're allowed in the following , the idea of a variation , pick .
and the variation in with the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would any of them to this event go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it 's only time .
it there ai to what it .
they 're allowed <unk> , like that in the future , it there .
and again , it sounds first time a great in the first moment .
i trial , i 'm not yet , one explanation .
and it , because i , i 'm you ca n't really has or pick up or shape , <unk> .
one , because the classic <unk> often , far too late <unk> .
that is , mostly they do n't have an opportunity , really , your suggestions to make or the alternatives to discuss them , but there 's actually , ai design and they 're allowed <unk> , decide , if you <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , like a friend who recently , what color the trash can have the example .
second kind of classic <unk> 's rarely spoke about information and vote out .
you think , three <unk> varieties .
we have here what , that we want to show you and they allowed to then you can vote .
the frustration and mutual incomprehension -- are often the follow what i also kind of really think .
i anyway , to no choice about <unk> or <unk> make when i actually rather ai <unk> way of <unk> <unk> had .
it 's but also different .
even telling us , overcoming the have <unk> of those in fact , we ultimately , it disturbed experience .
that we experience them and the i want now for other <unk> share .
i want it too , other initiatives , at the other projects , but also , or , , the city and , politics .
because that the ones who are , like <unk> actually do to , and the really responsible for these are .
if , which is really the interest in the participation of the way it so often to struggle and that they 're going then we and then we need the them in new <unk> .
ca n't last <unk> ' i but also , they all , you today , sit here .
and it 's why , because i <unk> for very important to think .
i , `` it for important , all go , and i want you with our example , encourage the <unk> still a chance to be .
and i then i me , they all , because you who are , in the them in a new <unk> demand .
so we have to participation look like to the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for their neighborhood and feel like , my involvement and <unk> to stir up ?
one willingness for the dialogue going on playing field .
in <unk> meet the professionals , on a layman to the citizens on <unk> and different kinds of interest them .
what we see here , is a picnic table , to the we invited to have .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal to be , all these conversations on playing field of this is , so , not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills about the missing in the citizens .
the citizens , place are experts , they 're experts , for their neighborhood , you know , what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to connect , in which tradition , a place is , and also , what you , and a missing .
the <unk> , all , the city can bring , on <unk> level in the project to do .
in as well , or in in a particular case , then another <unk> be involved in the themes of complimenting , just on the project and are the after .
all that leads to a <unk> , all of information for all that are and the then the place to can .
by may also found traces , can be , a positive identification of the place to .
a dialogue going on playing also means that the wishes of residents in fact taken seriously .
and it also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> next to the marketplace .
that can course , in again , he got to be , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialogue with all that <unk> , what 's the right solution and maybe in <unk> , the <unk> of the technology , but maybe in one another place .
well , that to figure out of the dialogue out , then .
second point are ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels , totally probably , when he ago <unk> large group is , and you can talk .
a other , it 's good writing to but the text , then not going on <unk> large group .
a , ooh , perhaps better or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to be different <unk> give to transform flavors of user to .
we have here , a way , just to come , there , , first time to watch , what happens .
in the background , ai small exhibition .
we have here the opportunity had , <unk> .
we have the opportunity had to paint .
we have the opportunity had to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the way , our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
also the way , outside of <unk> <unk> , to participate , should always been to be .
that can , for about a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .
the basis , and transparent having the results of the dialogue , among the everyone .
we even have the entire process in parallel postulate on facebook with him and on a piece of independent blog , and the news <unk> about a establishes distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you remember , perhaps , that i said that <unk> often , too late in place .
at my <unk> event there 's already three finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process , but only then when he early intervention happening and the them best , even still do n't know , with <unk> area happen to .
if through the dialogue , and so i went back to the point , one got to be discussed this is the scenarios for an area in a puzzle coming .
<unk> heard the way , to <unk> itself .
and that then , if not of the beginning , that is that the <unk> event , and so i look , but the experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , if , citizens in your city , academics and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous projects .
i , here 's an example of <unk> , is the <unk> , is probably , you here 's known .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's hear , <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> are there , six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding to make should or at least <unk> .
the time has to in august i wrote the politics , he could not different , as the idea to their own .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i do n't even more to say , because he now to one of the <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or educational administration .
the point , the <unk> for the <unk> were already .
in <unk> , so we 're going back in germany would have the citizens , so plans to very essence of a sense , again <unk> .
the city was told <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , we for <unk> <unk> have the rich , as <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e there it works and the city of the <unk> the initiative , there 's started , and other <unk> supported .
and elsewhere paint the citizens , their crossing the road .
in rotterdam , there was a <unk> <unk> .
everything well , so far , you want now say .
then we do but now , just so on .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of responsibility to happen .
why ?
one thing , , because they yes , a look for a 's all have or should have .
during the dedicated , it be the citizens of initiatives , or businesses , in the time on a for you in some form the relevant than in the focus has the city against the responsibility for the projects , also the attention .
and the other of course , the city of the projects are taking , are other means to .
a <unk> initiative , this just <unk> put them .
also our goal was the way , a temporary initiative , after her to plan was about half a year of the results and the responsibility , the city , who wanted .
-- was a <unk> has the villa out in january .
it run , when there .
so we have , now in the problem , we the responsibility , not that could .
but we know , now , that the city of the villa successful <unk> the negotiation that actually are successful , then a <unk> of this is going .
in what form of happening is , however , frankly .
to finally , now , i 'm convinced of , many projects , because of their meaning , complexity or , their plummeting cost of the city has evolved to have a chance of happiness that 's blessing and positive identification , to create .
if you just in time and in dialogue with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all , you today at night , sit here .
if we have , as calling for and at the fall because the <unk> the citizens did n't even more than just annoying would perceive , but as profitable .
that 's it .
the night , the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> for .
we have about <unk> talked about .
so this idea , ai n't second chance to have , if it in life did n't really , just , ai n't second chance .
we identified very exciting .
and we were , but relatively fast we agree that , two things that there , we do n't , see that we wanted .
this is the puberty .
the second , there was also , of the table , the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember , perhaps more humble out <unk> .
at me is it , are now that <unk> years ago , but the words to lead , i immediately to <unk> hands .
my neck straps , together and i 'll just go back on it 's the loo .
and then i 'm not , how it on you was , but in my exams , was , the one that with the <unk> taken seriously , the was always the next to me .
no idea , what kind of actually .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was really not beautiful and after i then my last <unk> behind me was completely clear , never again school .
and what should i now say , when i on the year <unk> back of the most days , i spent . i , i did , i in schools spent .
with a desire and , voluntary .
how did it that ?
like this happened ?
that just started time , so , that something happens is , what i do n't do it could .
i got kids .
so , my wife 's got the children .
and that was actually , very clear , one is , to that <unk> to do was .
to the a day , when they said , it 's <unk> .
and today , do you .
yes , <unk> .
there was i the door and then i was sitting there is sort of in this <unk> and whoa , i felt thrown in the <unk> .
that i saw , from the way that 's time , we looked .
and that <unk> also still so how much like school at <unk> , and i <unk> ' me , human being here , yes , real failure .
and when i then the teacher , say , i heard , and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i told me , oh my god , the sentence . i ' i mean , then , not <unk> .
what is that , what we from high school , from this high school , for a 's life really them have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good at that .
where you have actually in your life <unk> , time i really well we can ?
and you may have some , the capital from yugoslavia means .
what is , in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , this ability in short time as much know , in , <unk> , just , so i do it then on a button again <unk> can , to me a bad will ?
well , i , in the time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what he says , a <unk> of one point , one of it from whether someone , one good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good and diagnostic of has ?
no way .
so , no way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we look back , about <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , like that , you voted .
this is the time , in the in germany , the <unk> then some completely was introduced .
and where we also the educational system , how we do it today , its roots .
and if we the time , then imagine , it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , they 're kind of forced to have been , the school to go and with you know of been that were then we really the only way , had to collaborate with what you know , and the facts and the information their time in contact , .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket , as the library of time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that is , there , some changes in the world and there were suddenly people needs , these new machines service could .
the same time , but also people needs , these machines , wait , and repair it could .
and we need people , these machines to build it could and the these factories were .
maybe they pick it already .
that <unk> system , that we now in germany , you ask you still have , has its root in this time .
and has been there be a sense .
also , because it was probably really that was , that , what i in the school , that i did , for the work on the assembly line well , who the assembly line was , stood there be for life .
we do <unk> at the future .
we let that <unk> century , where it is , and we look at the year <unk> .
the year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just a moment before to pop .
i was with my , and i finished and i thought , now is the time , now do you pick up , the first company .
yes , after some to me around and so with the internet , <unk> ' i , <unk> ' i think that now , this time .
and some of companies are , we <unk> and they were always gets bigger and always gets bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then , us again , in the case <unk> .
you see , two time in life .
and we then after a few years , but over the staff .
so , we had so , such a growth and we had so exciting when professions , on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you ai n't valued concrete , we have , what these people do , but when i the school was we had no idea that , so what ever would give them .
even when i <unk> did was from so what 's like the internet , not talking about .
and the children , we now the school to what good job to the in 10 , six , 20 or 30 years have ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know , which are going to the need to stand in this future jobs , to be ?
and if you 're honest , there 's the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so in the future looking , who could tell me because the <unk> for the saturday .
there 's <unk> ticket , i did , i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how we can get then out to school for a 's lives learning it ?
so what are the things we need to kids for a 's life to fit to do ?
and maybe it 's so a lens , in that , what companies today , they 're .
that that are yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and to come and then in the company .
and if you , so this ai n't see classic <unk> at , then there is , first , yes , so what the expertise .
there to the , so the reading , then , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and of 12 years in offshore .
that 's going to school right now , and also in the future can not afford .
what school , but perhaps , but to be , are the things , always important , are the so called <unk> <unk> and i am , convinced of , this <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the future will be .
and the you can essentially , in three discrete groups .
that is , the company , too , and staff , the fact that are , so flexibility in that 's a .
and then i wish , almost all companies employees , they tend to think .
and then i wish , these companies , the <unk> .
so we flexibility leaders , thinking and predicts that .
we start with the flexibility .
that 's relatively quickly to understand .
if we look at the economy now works , how fast , yes , how fast , everything is changing .
<unk> , at the whole business models are the internet of today on the morning on the head asked .
there practice , i , the with this change can deal .
there practice , i , the creative .
there practice , i , the <unk> .
that 's pretty much exactly the opposite of the what in the factory in the <unk> century of collaborators at the line of it had .
also the second subject of the entrepreneurial think is clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's going to people , take responsibility .
first time for instance , and her own life .
but also for the big a whole .
if that now , the company is , or , as a society , wishing that we people , take responsibility for the big a whole .
and the third factor , the theory predicts , is almost the most do .
and if we , soccer cup remember , then there 's there in the internet for this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't <unk> <unk> the world cup won .
that were able to the only in common to create .
and this , somebody , this big , and innovator -- our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was not the , the iphone , invented has , has not the <unk> invented , has items would n't invented , has nothing of them .
the had a team , that that made possible , because just as a team who were the do that what they did .
so this ai at school , these three things that could , that is something , ai at school , in the we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth point , and the is me almost more important .
and that 's learning .
if the one , what we think about the future with security , we can tell is , uncertainty is then , this is the ability , new to learn and fun , to have this learning to see the <unk> for instance , we in later life , and that our children in later life are successful .
that is something , but it ai at school , these things that .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of them , the kids have , to know , that 's not just ai event is , for the you <unk> to pay .
so this ai event , after the slogan , all said , not from each other .
to the time , where <unk> who will , there will then suddenly all of invisible .
yes , i was sitting there and what should i do , <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest lists of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if so the stress , around the theme of homework and learn the whole family <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , when the kid was sick , because in the school stress , there .
and finally ended up this <unk> or was a peak of <unk> , this school , again , 'n <unk> .
right , we took it was also not <unk> , it was more so a <unk> , so right after the hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , were invited .
and i <unk> , you now , and also told me the detail by the time after the point was , we need to our child , your calculators , that 's not .
<unk> are , but two years , where we did have , does anything .
what do we really wrong ?
and we 'd actually the question i asked that 's our child , fail ?
and we are the only , where it that 's how ?
now i did , i in the last two years , since i put in the subject i 'm involved with very many people talked and i did , that , no way i , learned , you 're not alone .
there are very many , where it very similar to go and that was two years ago , i was sitting with <unk> <unk> together we were just , a company to the reasons , have to walk around us about where the journey , there goes , and night , we sat , the bar and we were about the private things to be exchanged .
and what should i do , he has to me almost the same story with a his children 's almost the same thing i know how we , and we had the lucky that we our children there 's take the minds from high school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one , it ai <unk> , different schools and we could even more schools in to consider .
but can that everyone out there are doing ?
somehow was that tell us to little bit , just our children in safety to and this it out there , to let the way they are .
and after we both the impression that had to school , since we were there is not that really changed we thought , well , we are the first , the topic that now time to do .
just , how do we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good thing is , we deceive them .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast , ai whole range of amazing people found , what a similar to how we , ai at school to create , all are related to this is .
it is yes , not so , just the children and their parents lying under the suffering , out there are often happens .
if we the teacher at , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look , the <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the , doubled .
it can now be , all parents , what 's wrong to do ?
that all children 's broken are and that , this lady teacher is broken are ?
or it can be , we have a system have , that just not , does , this <unk> ago <unk> years , does it also not , right .
and we have many people found , where it , went and we even people found , not have children .
and they 've got you to take responsibility to the future that you take responsibility to the future , take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , now the school , with the way to be .
and we , <unk> second , we 've gotten there 's out there ai whole range of literacy one of initiatives , the school to change want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really great <unk> and there 's almost , every school teacher , really involved , are and something to change .
and there 's even the , or other brave principal , the , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we now as <unk> help ?
we had yes , no concept , we there are now , to help you could .
but we just one thing , do , we can in these schools , and we can , these schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can , where in two days , ai whole bunch of moving .
there are coming so people , in the past more so each other have been working and the learning in two days , what it means to get to work .
the come with <unk> , concrete challenge , you in common problems .
and after two of those days have the then , for a new <unk> developed sooner or the underdog , for this ai n't totally new high as we in berlin to school , with anywhere .
or the have this tangible things for <unk> problems , you in their school have , evolved .
, two days in developed new approaches , the next day , which can be .
but what that i could is , what these two days happens , and that makes it for me then so beautiful the number of the weekends , i , then also time , schools , germany to spend , is this energy , there is what if the three things better .
if the three things together to experience , so what the flexibility <unk> .
so sort of leaders , thinking and if you , team to experience .
then what does that a spark , etc. .
and if we four weeks after that <unk> workshop , so this ai at school back then you know , we realized that , the school as a whole started , to change , there ai n't totally new culture that 's .
and that 's incredibly hot .
and i <unk> ' , maybe invite the new about the school to think .
i <unk> ' , maybe invite the school , thinking .
and i <unk> , you , also to invite , about the school , to talk .
talk you about that , what you like , but i talk , they also that , what you do n't like .
they will be surprised , how much disturbed , you get and how many people did the have lived , but just not talking about it .
they let us , let us every school in germany , into <unk> century , to .
they let us the entire system .
and they let us the common to do with the people the school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because it all together we can do this .
thank you .
